1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,970
Independent component analysis is

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,560
a method similar to PCA and random projection

3
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:09,299
in that it takes a set of features and

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,600
produces a different set that is useful in some way.

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:18,015
But it's different in that while PCA works to maximize variance,

6
00:00:18,015 --> 00:00:22,394
ICA assumes that the features are mixtures of

7
00:00:22,394 --> 00:00:24,929
independent sources and it tries to isolate

8
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:28,605
these independent sources that are sort of mixed in this dataset.

9
00:00:28,605 --> 00:00:33,659
The classic example used to explain ICA is something called the cocktail party problem.

10
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:36,989
Let's look at a variation of this problem.

11
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:42,975
So let's say that three of your friends go to an art show and there are three curtains.

12
00:00:42,975 --> 00:00:47,160
One of them opens up and there's a person playing

13
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:51,119
a piano and they play a nice tune on the piano.

14
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:57,644
You weren't there to listen to it so you assume that it sounded good.

15
00:00:57,645 --> 00:01:00,495
And then after a little bit of time

16
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:06,390
another curtain is uncovered and there's a person playing the cello.

17
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,870
And the piano is still playing and then cello starts playing but

18
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,695
they're playing two different pieces that don't really work together.

19
00:01:13,694 --> 00:01:16,859
So there's sort of mixing together.

20
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:23,250
And then the third curtain is opened and then there's a TV turned on

21
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:30,254
and there's just this sign wave noise coming and it's a little bit of a mess.

22
00:01:30,254 --> 00:01:33,486
And so here your friends decide that,

23
00:01:33,486 --> 00:01:34,589
okay, this is kind of interesting.

24
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,859
Let's take our phones out and record this.

25
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:45,060
So they record let's say six seconds of audio for this and so each person,

26
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,530
this friend was closer to the piano so they have more piano and they're recording.

27
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,310
This person was closer to the TV so they have more TV.

28
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,135
And so you have these three recordings.

29
00:01:57,135 --> 00:02:02,670
And then each of them has a different level of the original source which you don't have.

30
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,920
You don't have these recordings.

31
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,020
So the first one sounds kind of like this

32
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:19,574
where the TV noise is a little faint and you can hear the piano and the cello.

33
00:02:19,574 --> 00:02:29,579
The second one, there's a little bit more cello and the TV got louder.

34
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,969
And the third one we can even see it here that the TV is the loudest.

35
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,930
So if you have only these three recordings,

36
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,775
is there a way for you to retrieve the original signals datasets?

37
00:02:47,775 --> 00:02:49,905
And the answer is yes.

38
00:02:49,905 --> 00:02:55,319
That's what an example of what independent component analysis allows you to do.

39
00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:00,614
And so ICA takes these three samples or this dataset

40
00:03:00,615 --> 00:03:04,500
of three dimensions and

41
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,900
we tell it there are three original components that were in there,

42
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,715
so can you find them in here?

43
00:03:10,715 --> 00:03:18,715
So it would output piano.

44
00:03:18,715 --> 00:03:23,229
So when it's able to work it is able to isolate them.

45
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:34,589
And then the second output would be the cello and then the TV would be the last one.

46
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:43,044
And so this is a type of problem called the blind

47
00:03:43,044 --> 00:03:48,139
source separation and that's the problem that ICA solves.
