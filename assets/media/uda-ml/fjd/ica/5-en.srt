00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,830
To implement independent component analysis in scikit-learn,

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,310
we import FastICA, and then,

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:13,449
our datasets can be a list,

4
00:00:13,449 --> 00:00:15,744
or an array containing other arrays.

5
00:00:15,744 --> 00:00:16,869
So, here, signal one,

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:17,964
signal two, signal three,

7
00:00:17,964 --> 00:00:20,589
these can be wave files,

8
00:00:20,589 --> 00:00:25,750
and we zip them into one dataset.

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,509
And then, we declare FastICA,

10
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,190
and we give it the number of components,

11
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,664
the original components that we want to retrieve.

12
00:00:32,664 --> 00:00:35,424
And then, we tell it to fit, and then,

13
00:00:35,424 --> 00:00:43,099
components would contain the independent components that the algorithm was able to find.
