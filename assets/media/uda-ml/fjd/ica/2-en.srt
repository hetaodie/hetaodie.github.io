00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:07,734
The implementation of random prediction in scikit-learn is pretty straightforward.

2
00:00:07,735 --> 00:00:15,730
So, we just import the library here and then we declare it.

3
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,274
SparseRandomProjection is the faster.

4
00:00:18,274 --> 00:00:19,939
So, there's a Gaussian random projection.

5
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,300
There's SparseRandomProjection.

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,295
This is a little bit more performant.

7
00:00:25,295 --> 00:00:27,310
And then we fit.transform,

8
00:00:27,309 --> 00:00:31,724
pass in our dataset, and then we get the new transformed dataset.

9
00:00:31,725 --> 00:00:37,329
And so, here, if we want to declare or specify a specific value for epsilon,

10
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:44,329
we pass it here, or if we want to force it into a specific size or number of components.

11
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:46,015
If we don't specify anything,

12
00:00:46,015 --> 00:00:50,230
the number of components is automatic and it's calculated

13
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:56,039
by using epsilon and by using the number of points or samples in the dataset,

14
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,109
so to choose based on the dataset.
