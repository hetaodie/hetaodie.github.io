1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,439
In terms of applications,

2
00:00:02,439 --> 00:00:06,925
ICA is widely used in medical scanners.

3
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:13,455
And so, this is an example of a type of brain scan called the EEG or MEG,

4
00:00:13,455 --> 00:00:17,865
where each of these sensors detects

5
00:00:17,864 --> 00:00:25,689
electric signals or in a similar test magnetic signals inside the brain.

6
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:31,020
And so each of these is you know the electric sensor and each of them would produce

7
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:38,024
these readings that are all mixtures of things happening inside the brain.

8
00:00:38,024 --> 00:00:46,714
And so ICA can be used where these are the initial or actual readings of this data.

9
00:00:46,715 --> 00:00:52,965
ICA is an algorithm that's able to look at them and then find the independent components

10
00:00:52,965 --> 00:00:59,655
inside the brain that generated these readings and where, that are mixed here.

11
00:00:59,655 --> 00:01:05,609
Because an electric signal would be generating when one part of the brain would bounce,

12
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:09,659
would be hard to tell because you have the skull separating

13
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,784
the sensors from the actual places.

14
00:01:13,784 --> 00:01:17,924
So ICA is widely used in scenarios like this.

15
00:01:17,924 --> 00:01:24,164
It's also used in FMRIs the same way for a lot of brain scans.

16
00:01:24,165 --> 00:01:27,840
So these are the independent components and it can isolate

17
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,275
where certain signals came from in the brain.

18
00:01:32,275 --> 00:01:39,310
There have been attempts at using ICA for financial data.

19
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,424
I don't know that this is a very popular thing to do,

20
00:01:42,424 --> 00:01:45,039
but it's just interesting to look at I guess.

21
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:53,930
And so this is one paper that tries to apply ICA to a factor model in finance let's say.

22
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:59,065
So this data is stocks, stock signals.

23
00:01:59,064 --> 00:02:04,620
And it tries to isolate what caused the stocks to go up and down,

24
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,668
what components are there.

25
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:12,205
And most of these papers that are trying to do ICA in finance, something like this.

26
00:02:12,205 --> 00:02:14,790
The economy is completely,

27
00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:20,625
is a very complex system and so they rarely would come up with

28
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:26,502
things that are of deep need, of real value.

29
00:02:26,502 --> 00:02:30,659
It just could be interesting to look at, I guess.

30
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:36,930
There's another one looking at financial data as well.

31
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:43,689
And so this is a data set of five stores and this is the cash flow of them.

32
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:45,419
So there's a chain,

33
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:47,649
a retail chain of some sort.

34
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:54,030
And so this is the cash flow over 140 weeks.

35
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,735
And so you see spikes that go up and they go down.

36
00:02:57,735 --> 00:03:00,385
To make it a little bit more clear, let's break it down.

37
00:03:00,384 --> 00:03:02,317
So this is the first year,

38
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:04,250
this is the second year,

39
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,034
and this is a part of the third year that is available.

40
00:03:08,034 --> 00:03:11,423
So you can see dip here,

41
00:03:11,423 --> 00:03:12,905
or spike and then a dip.

42
00:03:12,905 --> 00:03:17,122
This is about Christmastime I guess.

43
00:03:17,122 --> 00:03:19,019
So if we do ICA to this,

44
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,844
we get these four components.

45
00:03:21,844 --> 00:03:29,099
And they would give some indication of things that are happening.

46
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:33,090
So this first component captures this rise,

47
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,969
the spike and dip in Christmas for example.

48
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:41,147
And this fourth one captures the,

49
00:03:41,147 --> 00:03:48,080
during the summer month there seems to be a bit of a slump here.

50
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,304
So this is another thing that I thought is interesting to look at.

51
00:03:52,305 --> 00:03:57,640
There aren't a lot of papers or applications of using ICA

52
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:03,349
in a financial data but it could be intriguing.
