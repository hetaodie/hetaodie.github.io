00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,424
Scikit-learn makes it as easy to do GMM clustering as the other clustering methods which,

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:13,890
basically, we have to import the mixture library from scikit-learn and Gaussian mixture.

3
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,900
And we handed the number of components,

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,254
number of clusters we were after.

5
00:00:18,254 --> 00:00:19,890
We handed the dataset.

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,484
It fits it, and then we can predict and get the labels for all the points,

7
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:27,869
all the samples in our dataset
