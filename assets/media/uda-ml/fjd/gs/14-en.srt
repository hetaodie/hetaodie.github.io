1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,509
Cluster validation is the procedure of evaluating

2
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:07,899
the results of a clustering objectively and quantitatively.

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,595
There are three categories of cluster validation indices.

4
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:14,730
The first are external indices.

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,365
And these are the scoring methods that we use if our data was originally labeled.

6
00:00:19,364 --> 00:00:22,409
So, if we have a data set that is actually labelled,

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,199
we can use external indices to score how a clustering method did.

8
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,589
But most of the time,

9
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:33,539
the data that we have is not labelled specifically with unsupervised learning.

10
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:38,126
And so these are the cases where internal indices can be helpful

11
00:00:38,127 --> 00:00:43,290
and these measure the fit between the data and structure using only the data.

12
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:46,140
The third category is relative indices,

13
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,560
and these indicate which of two clustering structures is better in some sense.

14
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,770
Basically, all internal indices can serve as relative indices.

15
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:01,650
Most validation indices are defined by compacting compactness and separability.

16
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:04,439
Compactness is basically a measure of how

17
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,781
close the elements of a cluster are to each other,

18
00:01:07,781 --> 00:01:13,129
while separability is how far or distinct clusters are from each other.

19
00:01:13,129 --> 00:01:15,435
The general assumption here is that

20
00:01:15,435 --> 00:01:19,200
clustering methods are generally expected to produce clusters where

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,109
the elements of a cluster are the most similar to each

22
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:26,275
other and the clusters are the most distinct from each other.

23
00:01:26,275 --> 00:01:28,980
If this sounds a bit too theoretical, that's okay.

24
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,000
We'll look at specific indices in the next videos.
