1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,930
Now that we have looked at how single-link clustering works,

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,140
let's take a minute to compare it

3
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:11,070
with k-means on these datasets that we've looked at before.

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,380
So, for the first one,

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,440
k-means seemed to do a better job at breaking down

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,760
this uniformly distributed datasets into three clusters.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,050
While in single-link, we can see that one drawback of

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,910
one cluster eating up the entire dataset and then two clusters being small.

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,990
So, it seems that k-means does a better job in this case.

10
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,700
With the two crescents,

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,250
single-link is able to carve them out perfectly.

12
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,960
This is because these datasets are close to each

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,520
other and then there's a good amount of separation between the two crescents.

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,465
And so, this is a case where a single-ink does better than k-means.

15
00:00:51,465 --> 00:00:57,720
Two rings is another really well-done job for a single-link.

16
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,629
It carves them out beautifully.

17
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,020
We have the inside ring and

18
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,945
the outside ring as the two clusters that we were looking for.

19
00:01:03,945 --> 00:01:05,579
In this dataset here,

20
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:07,664
k-means does a better job here.

21
00:01:07,665 --> 00:01:10,965
We have one cluster that went and ate up everything.

22
00:01:10,965 --> 00:01:14,685
So, not the best job for single-link here.

23
00:01:14,685 --> 00:01:19,469
This is not the best job as well, I mean,

24
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:22,090
but it's able to carve this one out,

25
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:27,960
but this cluster of one point is not really very meaningful or helpful to us.

26
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:34,079
And with this, it does the same job that k-means did.

27
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,459
But there is one additional thing that we can get out of this,

28
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:39,629
which we've discussed before,

29
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:43,685
is the hierarchies or the dendrograms that result from this.

30
00:01:43,685 --> 00:01:45,150
So, let's look at them.

31
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,070
So, with this uniform,

32
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:49,619
we can see, this is how it looks.

33
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:54,295
And we don't really get much information from the hierarchy here.

34
00:01:54,295 --> 00:01:58,125
We can kind of tell that there are no clear clusters that

35
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:02,385
we can break the datasets down into.

36
00:02:02,385 --> 00:02:04,245
With the two crescents,

37
00:02:04,245 --> 00:02:08,504
we can see that there is one cluster here and then another cluster here,

38
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:12,164
and they're separated by a lot of distance.

39
00:02:12,164 --> 00:02:16,609
And while we can tell that visually by looking at this one graph here,

40
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,394
one thing that's important is that,

41
00:02:19,394 --> 00:02:21,450
what if our dataset had three,

42
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:23,729
or four, or 10, or 100 dimensions?

43
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:26,849
We will not be able to graph it into dimensions like

44
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:31,180
this and just easily be able to visually tell that they're separated.

45
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,795
But no matter how many dimensions we have,

46
00:02:33,794 --> 00:02:38,364
we can produce a dendrogram into dimensions that would look exactly like this.

47
00:02:38,365 --> 00:02:44,310
And so, this is a real valuable way for us to be able to visualize datasets,

48
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,360
even if they have multiple dimensions.

49
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,420
With the two rings, we can also see the two structures clearly here,

50
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:54,489
separated by a lot of distance.

51
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,260
So, this is very useful.

52
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,750
I love this example.

53
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,780
So, well, single-link was not able to find,

54
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,616
and this cluster has one closer,

55
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:03,900
and I define this point,

56
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,870
this group, as another cluster, let's say.

57
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:12,090
In the hierarchy, you can see that there are three structures.

58
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:17,133
Even if the direct result is not indicative of the three clusters that you want,

59
00:03:17,133 --> 00:03:19,365
the dentrogram actually tells you something,

60
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,960
that maybe you if can experiment a little bit,

61
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,365
maybe try other hierarchical clustering methods,

62
00:03:25,365 --> 00:03:29,530
you can be able to isolate three separate clusters.

63
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,259
And this also works very well here.

64
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:36,000
So, while we wanted to find these three clusters, this is one,

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,175
and this is two, and this is three,

66
00:03:39,175 --> 00:03:40,530
it wasn't able to do it,

67
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,060
but if we look at the dendrogram,

68
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,280
we can easily see that.

69
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,800
This seems to be like a cluster,

70
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,890
this seems to be like cluster,

71
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:48,099
and this seems to be like cluster.

72
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:50,655
So, the dendrograms give us

73
00:03:50,655 --> 00:03:57,657
additional insights that maybe the direct results of the clustering misses.

74
00:03:57,657 --> 00:04:00,480
And here, we can see this is a very easy example

75
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,869
where there is a lot of distance separating those three,

76
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,254
and these two are closer to each other.

77
00:04:07,254 --> 00:04:11,800
So, these two are these two structures here.

78
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,514
And so, this is an examination of

79
00:04:13,514 --> 00:04:17,995
how a single-link compares and how useful these dendrograms can be.

80
00:04:17,995 --> 00:04:22,019
Let's proceed by looking at other types of hierarchical clustering.
