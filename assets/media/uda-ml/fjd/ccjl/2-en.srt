1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,759
In this lesson, we'll look at two more clustering methods.

2
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:06,330
The first one is called Hierarchical Clustering,

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,705
and it results in a structure of clusters that gives us

4
00:00:09,705 --> 00:00:13,484
a visual indication of how clusters relate to each other.

5
00:00:13,484 --> 00:00:16,649
And then, we'll look at Density-based Clustering.

6
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:20,129
Specifically, we'll look at an algorithm called DBSCAN,

7
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:25,559
which stands for Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise,

8
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:28,469
which is robust against datasets with noise,

9
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:31,660
and does not require us to specify a number of clusters.

10
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,465
Basically, it clusters points that are densely packed together,

11
00:00:36,465 --> 00:00:39,465
and labels other points as noise.

12
00:00:39,465 --> 00:00:44,070
And this is an algorithm that works really well on the two-crescent dataset.

13
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,000
So, let's start by looking at hierarchical clustering in the next video.
