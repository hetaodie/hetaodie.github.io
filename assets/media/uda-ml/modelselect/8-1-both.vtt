00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
Congratulations. Now you have to learn how to train models, how to test them,

2
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
恭喜你 你已经学会如何训练模型 如何测试模型

3
00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.904
how to use certain metrics to evaluate how good these models are,

4
00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.904
如何使用某些指标来评估这些模型的效果

5
00:00:06.905 --> 00:00:10.554
and, finally, how to tune the parameters to improve your model.

6
00:00:06.905 --> 00:00:10.554
最后 如何调整参数来改善模型

7
00:00:10.554 --> 00:00:13.199
Now you are ready to get your hands on the project where you

8
00:00:10.554 --> 00:00:13.199
现在你已经准备好处理项目

9
00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:16.000
can put all of this knowledge in practice. Good luck.

10
00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:16.000
并将所学的知识运用到实践中 加油
