00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.420
So let's see. The true positives are the points that

2
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.439
我们来看一下

3
00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.439
真阳性是实际为阳性

4
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.140
are positive and the model correctly labels as positive.

5
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.150
且模型正确标记为阳性的点

6
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.570
These are the six blue points over here.

7
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.890
它们是这里的六个蓝色点

8
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.880
The true negatives are the points that are

9
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.870
真阴性是实际为阴性

10
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.155
negative and the model correctly labels as negative.

11
00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:15.160
且模型阳性确标记为阴性的点

12
00:00:15.155 --> 00:00:18.650
These are the five negative red points over here.

13
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.803
它们是这里的五个阴性的红色点

14
00:00:17.803 --> 00:00:20.996
假阳性是实际为阴性

15
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.970
The false positives are the points that are negative

16
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.970
but the model incorrectly labels as positive.

17
00:00:20.996 --> 00:00:23.960
但模型错误标记为阳性的点

18
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.230
它们是这里的两个红点

19
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.220
These are these two red points over here.

20
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.340
And finally, the false negatives are the points that

21
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.271
最后 假阴性是实际为阳性

22
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.195
are positive but the model incorrectly labels as negative.

23
00:00:30.271 --> 00:00:32.475
但模型标记为阴性的点

24
00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:35.939
就是这里这个蓝色点

25
00:00:33.195 --> 00:00:35.930
That's just this blue point over here.

26
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.130
So there we go. That's the confusion matrix.

27
00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:36.960
就这样

28
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.160
这就是混淆矩阵
