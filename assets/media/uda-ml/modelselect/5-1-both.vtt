00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.915
In this section, we'll learn a way to tell overfitting,

2
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.915
在这部分 我们将学习如何判断是否过拟合

3
00:00:02.915 --> 00:00:04.735
欠拟合以及模型是否效果很好

4
00:00:02.915 --> 00:00:04.735
under-fitting and a good model.

5
00:00:04.735 --> 00:00:06.750
这是三组数据

6
00:00:04.735 --> 00:00:06.750
So, here we have our data three times.

7
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.589
Our data seems to be well split by a quadratic equation of degree two.

8
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.589
我们的数据似乎按照二次方程式很好地分布

9
00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:13.091
我们将尝试拟合三个模型

10
00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:13.091
So, we're going to try and fit three models.

11
00:00:13.092 --> 00:00:15.690
The first one, a linear or degree one model,

12
00:00:13.092 --> 00:00:15.690
第一个是线性（一次）模型

13
00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:21.509
效果不是太好 因为欠拟合 所以是个偏差很高的模型

14
00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:21.509
which doesn't do a very good job since it under fits so it's a high bias model.

15
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.295
The second one, a quadratic model of degree two, which is just right.

16
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.295
第二个是二次方程式模型 效果不错

17
00:00:26.295 --> 00:00:29.460
第三个是六次多项式

18
00:00:26.295 --> 00:00:29.460
And the third one, a higher degree polynomial of degree

19
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.910
过拟合了 因此是高方差的模型

20
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.910
six which over fits so it's a high variance model.

21
00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:37.539
现在我们将画出一些曲线 以便区分这些模型

22
00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:37.539
Now, we'll draw some curves that will be able to tell these models apart.

23
00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:40.890
先从高偏差线性模型开始

24
00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:40.890
Let's start here with a high bias linear model.

25
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.299
我们先使用几个点训练该模型

26
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.299
We're going to start training the model with

27
00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:45.629
very few points and increase the number of points gradually.

28
00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:45.629
然后逐步增加点的数量

29
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.675
如果用四个点训练该模型

30
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.675
If we train this model with say four points,

31
00:00:48.674 --> 00:00:52.679
那么可以很好地拟合训练集

32
00:00:48.674 --> 00:00:52.679
we can do a pretty good job fitting the training set.

33
00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:56.542
因此训练误差很小 我们将误差绘制在右侧图表中

34
00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:56.542
So we have a tiny training error which we'll plot in the graph in the right,

35
00:00:56.542 --> 00:00:59.240
but once we evaluate in the cross-validation data,

36
00:00:56.542 --> 00:00:59.240
但是当我们评估交叉验证数据时

37
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.520
因为只使用四个点训练模型

38
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.520
well, since we have trained them all on only four points,

39
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.040
模型效果不会太好 因此交叉验证的误差肯定很高

40
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.040
it cannot be a very good model so it probably has a pretty high cross validation error.

41
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.045
我们不会显示交叉验证集

42
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.045
We won't show the cross validation set,

43
00:01:09.045 --> 00:01:12.725
but you can pretty much imagine any other random subset of this data.

44
00:01:09.045 --> 00:01:12.725
但是你可以想象出该数据的其他随机子集

45
00:01:12.724 --> 00:01:15.164
我们将交叉验证误差绘制在这里

46
00:01:12.724 --> 00:01:15.164
We plot the cross violation error over here,

47
00:01:15.165 --> 00:01:19.185
and now we increase to eight points and we train the linear model again.

48
00:01:15.165 --> 00:01:19.185
现在增加到 8 个点 再次训练线性模型

49
00:01:19.185 --> 00:01:23.575
训练误差可能会增大一点点 因为拟合八个点比四个点要困难

50
00:01:19.185 --> 00:01:23.575
The training error may increase a bit since it's harder to fit eight points than four,

51
00:01:23.575 --> 00:01:26.894
but since we have a slightly better model and we've used more data to train it,

52
00:01:23.575 --> 00:01:26.894
但是因为模型效果稍微好些 我们使用了更多的数据来训练它

53
00:01:26.894 --> 00:01:30.257
或许交叉验证误差降低了一点点

54
00:01:26.894 --> 00:01:30.257
then maybe the cross validation error has decreased a bit

55
00:01:30.257 --> 00:01:34.250
but not much since it's a linear model trying to fit quadratic data.

56
00:01:30.257 --> 00:01:34.250
但是幅度并不大 因为这是一个尝试拟合二次数据的线性模型

57
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.280
Here are the training and cross validation errors in the graph.

58
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.280
这是训练误差和交叉验证误差

59
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.480
Now, we increase to 12 points and we train the model again.

60
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.480
现在增多到 12 个点 重新训练模型

61
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.240
同样 训练误差可能会增大一点点 因为有更多的训练数据需要拟合

62
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.240
Once more, the training error may increase a bit since there's more training data to fit,

63
00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:48.780
但是交叉验证误差也会再降低一点点

64
00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:48.780
but the cross validation error will also decrease a

65
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.019
因为有一个用更多数据进行训练的更好模型了

66
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.019
bit since we have a better model to train with more data,

67
00:01:52.019 --> 00:01:54.829
but it still won't decrease by much.

68
00:01:52.019 --> 00:01:54.829
但是依然不会降低太多

69
00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.239
似乎随着点的数量越来越增多

70
00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.239
It seems that as we increase the number of points more and more,

71
00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:59.879
the training error will keep increasing and the testing error will

72
00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:59.879
训练误差将不断增大 测试误差

73
00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:02.859
keep decreasing so if we draw these two curves,

74
00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:02.859
将不断下降 如果画出这两条曲线

75
00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:05.250
they'll get closer and closer to each other,

76
00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:05.250
它们将越来越接近

77
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.319
and maybe converge at some point.

78
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.319
或许在某个点还会汇合

79
00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:09.900
汇合的点应该很高

80
00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:09.900
The point they converge should be high anyway since we don't

81
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.069
因为这两个模型是欠拟合的 它们的误差不会很小

82
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.069
expect these models to have small error as they are under-fitting.

83
00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.509
现在对二次方程式模型执行相同的操作

84
00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.509
Now, let's do the exact same thing with

85
00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:18.929
the quadratic model so let's remember that this is the good model.

86
00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:18.929
记住这个模型效果很好

87
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.180
Training with four points, just as before,

88
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.180
和之前一样 用四个点进行训练

89
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.939
we can do pretty well in the training set so we have a small training error,

90
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.939
训练集的效果很好 因此训练误差很小

91
00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:27.704
but since we trained the model in very few points,

92
00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:27.704
但是只用了非常少的点训练模型

93
00:02:27.705 --> 00:02:30.180
因此交叉验证集的结果可能不太理想

94
00:02:27.705 --> 00:02:30.180
we probably didn't do very well in the cross validation

95
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.540
set so our cross validation error is large.

96
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.540
因此交叉验证误差很大

97
00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:36.419
Now, if we increased to eight points, again,

98
00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:36.419
如果将点增多到 8 个

99
00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:40.379
our training error increases since we have more points to fit,

100
00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:40.379
训练误差增大了 因为有更多的点要拟合

101
00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.324
但是因为模型用更多的点进行训练 了解的信息更多

102
00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.324
but since our model knows more as it's trained on more points,

103
00:02:44.324 --> 00:02:49.049
then the cross validation error has decreased and if we go to 12 points,

104
00:02:44.324 --> 00:02:49.049
所以验证误差下降了 如果使用 12 个点进行训练

105
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.005
the same thing happens again.

106
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.005
出现同样的情况

107
00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:55.394
Training error increases, cross validation error decreases.

108
00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:55.394
训练误差增大了 交叉验证误差下降了

109
00:02:55.395 --> 00:03:01.890
和之前一样 这两条曲线越来越接近

110
00:02:55.395 --> 00:03:01.890
So, as before, these curves get closer and closer to each other except,

111
00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.439
now they convert to a lower point since the model is

112
00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.439
但是交点更低

113
00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:07.146
good and we expect expect it to have small error.

114
00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:07.146
因为模型效果很好 因此误差很小

115
00:03:07.146 --> 00:03:10.465
Finally, let's do the same thing with the degree six model.

116
00:03:07.146 --> 00:03:10.465
最后对六次模型执行相同的流程

117
00:03:10.465 --> 00:03:13.300
注意 这个模型会过拟合

118
00:03:10.465 --> 00:03:13.300
Let's remember that this is the model that over fits.

119
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.105
Let's train with four points.

120
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.105
用四个点进行训练

121
00:03:15.104 --> 00:03:19.094
同样 我们可以很轻松地拟合四个点 因此训练误差很小

122
00:03:15.104 --> 00:03:19.094
Again, we can fit four points very easily so we have a small training error.

123
00:03:19.094 --> 00:03:22.090
因为该模型了解的信息不多

124
00:03:19.094 --> 00:03:22.090
And again, as we don't have very much information for a point six model,

125
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.789
因此交叉验证集的效果不会很好

126
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.789
probably didn't do very well in the cross validation set,

127
00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:27.409
so we have a large cross validation error.

128
00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:27.409
因此交叉验证误差很大

129
00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:30.155
现在如果将训练集增大到 8 个点

130
00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:30.155
Now, if we increase the training set to eight points,

131
00:03:30.155 --> 00:03:32.460
训练误差稍微大了些

132
00:03:30.155 --> 00:03:32.460
we have a slightly large training error and

133
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.620
测试误差稍微小了些 和之前一样

134
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.620
a slightly smaller testing error just like before.

135
00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.305
如果将训练集增大到 8 个点

136
00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.305
Now, if we increase the training set to eight points,

137
00:03:40.305 --> 00:03:43.560
then we have a slightly larger training error and

138
00:03:40.305 --> 00:03:43.560
那么训练误差稍微大些

139
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.620
交叉验证误差稍微小些

140
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.620
a slightly smaller cross validation error and

141
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.319
this happens again for 12 points as we've seen before,

142
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.319
12 个训练点也是一样

143
00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.844
但是现在出现了有趣的现象

144
00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.844
but now, something interesting happens.

145
00:03:52.844 --> 00:03:55.169
训练误差始终不会变得太大

146
00:03:52.844 --> 00:03:55.169
The training error will never grow too large

147
00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:57.719
since models that overfit tend to do very well in

148
00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:57.719
因为过拟合的模型在训练集中效果会很好

149
00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:00.319
因为它们可以很好地拟合

150
00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:00.319
the training set as they can fit it very well

151
00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.224
and the cross validation error will never get too low,

152
00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.224
交叉验证误差始终不会太低

153
00:04:03.224 --> 00:04:08.609
因为我们看过过拟合的模型在交叉验证集中效果不太好

154
00:04:03.224 --> 00:04:08.609
since as we've seen models that overfit do not do very well in the cross validation set.

155
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.305
当我们增多训练点时

156
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.305
As we increase the number of points,

157
00:04:10.305 --> 00:04:11.859
these two curves will get closer,

158
00:04:10.305 --> 00:04:11.859
这两条曲线将更接近

159
00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.070
but will not converge to the same point.

160
00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.070
但是不会汇集成一点

161
00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.800
There will always be a distance between them.

162
00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.800
它们之间始终存在一定的距离

163
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.395
总结下 我们有三个模型

164
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.395
In summary, here we have three models: the high bias,

165
00:04:19.394 --> 00:04:21.365
高偏差模型 效果好的模型和高方差模型

166
00:04:19.394 --> 00:04:21.365
the good one and the high variance.

167
00:04:21.365 --> 00:04:23.670
在高偏差（欠拟合）模型中

168
00:04:21.365 --> 00:04:23.670
In the high bias or underfitting model,

169
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.330
the curves get close to each other and converge to a high point.

170
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.330
两条曲线相互接近并交于一点

171
00:04:27.329 --> 00:04:29.490
在效果好的模型中

172
00:04:27.329 --> 00:04:29.490
In the good model, the curves again,

173
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.444
曲线同样相互接近并交于一个很低的点

174
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.444
go close to each other and converge to a low point,

175
00:04:32.444 --> 00:04:34.685
在高方差（过拟合）模型中

176
00:04:32.444 --> 00:04:34.685
and in the high variance or overfitting model,

177
00:04:34.685 --> 00:04:37.439
the curves do not get close to each other.

178
00:04:34.685 --> 00:04:37.439
曲线没有相互接近

179
00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:40.913
The training one stays low and the cross validation one stays high.

180
00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:40.913
训练集保持很低 交叉验证集保持很高

181
00:04:40.913 --> 00:04:43.215
So this is a way to tell between under-fitting,

182
00:04:40.913 --> 00:04:43.215
这样就可以判断是否欠拟合

183
00:04:43.214 --> 00:04:45.739
过拟合或者正常

184
00:04:43.214 --> 00:04:45.739
overfitting, and just right.

185
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.660
We just look at the learning curves and see what shape they form.

186
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.660
我们直接查看训练曲线并看看它们的形状
