1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,774
So, to summarize, this is how I see machine learning.

2
00:00:02,774 --> 00:00:03,870
We have a problem to solve,

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,394
which is represented by this broken car over here,

4
00:00:06,394 --> 00:00:08,044
and we have some tools to fix it,

5
00:00:08,044 --> 00:00:10,754
which are the algorithms of machine learning.

6
00:00:10,755 --> 00:00:12,960
And finally, we have some measurement tools,

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,410
which we then use to measure each tool's performance.

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,140
Then, you pick the best tool to fix your car.

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,000
To be more specific in machine learning,

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,250
you have a problem which is some data you need to classify.

11
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,890
You also have a bunch of algorithms.

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,019
Things like neural networks, logistic regression,

13
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,750
polynomial regression, SVMs, decision trees,

14
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,234
random forests, et cetera.

15
00:00:32,234 --> 00:00:33,765
And we have a bunch of metrics.

16
00:00:33,765 --> 00:00:35,715
Things like model complexity graphs,

17
00:00:35,715 --> 00:00:38,895
accuracy precision recall F1 score,

18
00:00:38,895 --> 00:00:40,615
learning curves, et cetera.

19
00:00:40,615 --> 00:00:44,445
And what you do, is you use these ones to test your models,

20
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:45,810
see how they're doing.

21
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,775
Pick the best one and that's what you use to model your data.

22
00:00:49,774 --> 00:00:54,284
Then, when you have a new point, you can predict as label based on that model.

23
00:00:54,284 --> 00:00:56,399
And that's it. That's how you test,

24
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,000
evaluate, and validate models.
