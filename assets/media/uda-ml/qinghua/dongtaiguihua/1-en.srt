00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,029
For this lesson, we'll confine our attention to

2
00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:07,275
a problem that's slightly easier than the reinforcement learning problem.

3
00:00:07,275 --> 00:00:11,685
Instead of working in a setting where the agent has to learn from interaction,

4
00:00:11,685 --> 00:00:16,000
we'll assume that the agent already knows everything about the environment.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,875
So the agent knows how the environment decides the next state,

6
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:22,211
and it knows how the environment decides reward.

7
00:00:22,211 --> 00:00:25,504
The goal will remain the same.

8
00:00:25,504 --> 00:00:30,359
Given this information, the agent would like to find the optimal policy.

9
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,740
Solving the simpler problem first will prove incredibly useful for building

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:39,535
intuition before we tackle the full reinforcement learning problem.

11
00:00:39,534 --> 00:00:42,329
With this in mind, I'll catch you in the next video.
