00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,029
Actor-critic approaches are a variant of

2
00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:07,022
policy-based methods that reuse the idea of value functions.

3
00:00:07,022 --> 00:00:11,789
Remember, actor encodes the policy and critic encodes the value function,

4
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:14,504
tells the actor how good its policy is.

5
00:00:14,505 --> 00:00:18,570
And since we can choose to represent the actor and critic separately,

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,385
we suddenly have a lot more flexibility in designing our reinforcement learning agents.

7
00:00:23,385 --> 00:00:27,630
This has opened up a broad area of research where people are applying

8
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:32,119
reinforcement learning to problems that we could not even dream of solving before.

9
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,844
Deep mind surprise the world by beating humans at go,

10
00:00:35,844 --> 00:00:38,740
but it also helped reduce Google's data center

11
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:43,780
cooling bill by 40 percent using reinforcement learning.

12
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,855
Open AI is probably more famous for Gym,

13
00:00:46,854 --> 00:00:51,099
a platform that researchers can use to publish learning algorithms and

14
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:56,328
compare how they perform on different video games and simulated physics problems.

15
00:00:56,328 --> 00:01:01,210
But they are also applying reinforcement learning to teach real physical robots

16
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:06,655
to learn complex tasks like picking and placing blocks and imitating humans.

17
00:01:06,655 --> 00:01:10,349
Numerous other groups are actively pushing the boundaries

18
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:14,233
of what is possible to achieve using reinforcement learning,

19
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:16,919
and you can be a part of this community too.

20
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,250
But remember, to solve the next big challenge,

21
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,750
you need a healthy dose of creativity more than anything else.

22
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,155
Keep an eye on the latest advancements in the field.

23
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:29,966
Dive into research papers,

24
00:01:29,966 --> 00:01:31,530
articles, and blog posts.

25
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,325
Try to implement new algorithms and experiment with them.

26
00:01:35,325 --> 00:01:41,290
I'm really eager to see what problems you solve with reinforcement learning.
