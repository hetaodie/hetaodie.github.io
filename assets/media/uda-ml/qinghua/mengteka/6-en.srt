00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
So far, we've discussed how we might design the algorithm for Monte Carlo control.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,130
I mentioned in the last video that we

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,385
still have some work to do with the evaluation step.

4
00:00:11,384 --> 00:00:14,820
Towards this end, we discussed an algorithm for keeping

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,675
a running estimate of the mean of a sequence of numbers.

6
00:00:18,675 --> 00:00:23,160
Remember that this algorithm focused on one state action pair,

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,079
which was visited some number and times.

8
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:33,195
The algorithm looks at each visit in order and successively updates the mean new.

9
00:00:33,195 --> 00:00:35,737
So this algorithm currently,

10
00:00:35,737 --> 00:00:41,549
can only update the value function estimate corresponding to a single state action pair.

11
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:43,439
Our next step is to change it a bit,

12
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:48,384
so that it can maintain estimates of values for many state action pairs.

13
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:51,539
Then, we'll be able to plug in that algorithm as

14
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,435
a new and improved evaluation step. So here's what we'll do.

15
00:00:56,435 --> 00:01:01,005
The agent begins by sampling an episode from the environment.

16
00:01:01,005 --> 00:01:06,915
Then, for every time step we look at the corresponding state action pair.

17
00:01:06,915 --> 00:01:08,190
If it's a first visit,

18
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:10,724
we calculate the corresponding return.

19
00:01:10,724 --> 00:01:15,619
Then, in accordance with the algorithm we examined for keeping the running mean,

20
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,785
we then just update the corresponding estimate of the action value.

21
00:01:19,784 --> 00:01:25,090
And so when we go to plug in this stuff into our algorithm for our Monte Carlo control,

22
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,320
we also have to be careful to also initialize the number

23
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,339
of times we've visited each pair and we're getting there.

24
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,829
Your blackjack playing agent will soon have

25
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:38,069
a method for improving its strategy after every game.
