00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:07,480
Deep-Q learning is an elegant algorithm that demonstrates how you

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,470
can use neural networks to solve reinforcement learning problems.

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,506
It has expanded the range of domains we can tackle,

4
00:00:14,506 --> 00:00:18,175
especially those with large and continuous state spaces.

5
00:00:18,175 --> 00:00:21,565
I'm sure you're eager to find out how it works,

6
00:00:21,565 --> 00:00:24,370
that's exactly what we're going to do in this lesson.

7
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:29,950
We'll first take a look at how neural networks can be used to represent value functions.

8
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:34,225
Next, we'll adapt the two main classes of model free approaches,

9
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:39,320
Monte Carlo and Temporal-Difference Learning to work with this new representation.

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,274
Remember that Q-learning is a variant of TD learning,

11
00:00:43,274 --> 00:00:45,299
so this will prepare you to understand and

12
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:48,314
implement the Deep Q-learning algorithm yourself.

13
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:51,299
Finally, you'll learn how to harness the power of

14
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:54,659
deep learning including Convolutional and Recurrent Neural

15
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:57,959
Nets to teach computer's tasks that seem almost

16
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,950
impossible to learn from scratch like playing video games.
