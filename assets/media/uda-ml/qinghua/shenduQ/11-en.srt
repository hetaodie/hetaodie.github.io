1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,285
I hope you got a good sense of deep Q learning,

2
00:00:03,285 --> 00:00:08,594
how it combines the best of reinforcement learning with recent advances in deep learning.

3
00:00:08,595 --> 00:00:12,330
I also hope that you'll realize how this opens up a world of

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,490
possibilities for you to experiment

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,579
with different neural net architectures value functions,

6
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:23,119
learning algorithms and not to mention the wide variety of environments you can tackle.

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,010
Before you move on to studying other reinforcement learning approaches,

8
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,410
I encourage you to try and implement agents for

9
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,475
different problems especially on platforms like OpenAI Gym.

10
00:00:33,475 --> 00:00:37,225
See which ones deep Q learning is able to solve reliably,

11
00:00:37,225 --> 00:00:39,535
and which ones it finds challenging.

12
00:00:39,534 --> 00:00:44,140
That will help you gain a deeper understanding of the algorithm and motivate

13
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:49,370
the need for other approaches such as policy gradients and actor-critic methods.
