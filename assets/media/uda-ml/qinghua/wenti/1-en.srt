Hi and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:05,540
I hope you enjoyed the first lesson and walked away with

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:10,559
an understanding of how reinforcement learning is used in industry today.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,475
So far, we've started a conversation to illustrate

5
00:00:13,474 --> 00:00:16,669
the diverse potential of reinforcement learning techniques.

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,915
In this lesson, we'll continue the conversation and

7
00:00:19,914 --> 00:00:24,589
end with a rigorous definition for the reinforcement learning problem.

8
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:27,949
Specifically, you'll learn how to take a real world problem and

9
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:31,390
formulate it so it can be solved through reinforcement learning.
