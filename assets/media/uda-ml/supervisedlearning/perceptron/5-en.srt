1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
So first let's add some math.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,490
We're going to label the horizontal axis corresponding to the test by

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:11,320
the variable X1 and the vertical axis corresponding to the grades by the variable X2.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,250
So, this boundary line that separates the blue

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,675
and the red points is going to have a linear equation.

6
00:00:17,675 --> 00:00:22,820
The one drawn has equation 2X1 + X2 - 18 = 0.

7
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,219
What does this mean?

8
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:27,629
This means that our method for accepting or rejecting students

9
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:31,524
simply says the following: Take this equation as our score,

10
00:00:31,524 --> 00:00:34,734
the score is 2*Test + Grades - 18.

11
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:36,554
And when the student comes in, we check their score.

12
00:00:36,554 --> 00:00:38,015
If their score is a positive number,

13
00:00:38,015 --> 00:00:40,920
then we accept the student and if the score is a negative number,

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,579
then we reject the student.

15
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:44,408
This is called a prediction.

16
00:00:44,408 --> 00:00:47,765
We can say by convention that if the score is zero we'll accept a student,

17
00:00:47,765 --> 00:00:49,575
although this won't matter much at the end.

18
00:00:49,575 --> 00:00:53,140
And that's it. That linear equation is our model.

19
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,810
In the more general case our boundary

20
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,603
will be an equation of the form W1X1 + W2X2 + b = 0.

21
00:00:56,603 --> 00:01:04,549
We'll abbreviate this equation in vector notation of Wx + b = 0,

22
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:09,870
where W is the vector W1W2 and X is the vector X1X2.

23
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,364
And we simply take the product of the two vectors.

24
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:15,405
We refer to x as the input,

25
00:01:15,405 --> 00:01:16,694
the W as the weights,

26
00:01:16,694 --> 00:01:19,504
and the b as the bias.

27
00:01:19,504 --> 00:01:22,625
Now for a student cooordinates X1X2 will denote a label as y,

28
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:26,188
and the label is what we're trying to predict.

29
00:01:26,188 --> 00:01:29,279
So if the student gets accepted- namely the point is blue,

30
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,358
then the label is y = 1.

31
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:34,515
And if the student gets rejected- namely the point is red,

32
00:01:34,515 --> 00:01:36,959
and the label is y = 0.

33
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,859
Thus, each point is in the form X1X2

34
00:01:40,858 --> 00:01:45,718
y or y is one for the blue points and zero for the red points.

35
00:01:45,718 --> 00:01:48,479
And finally, our prediction is going to be called ŷ and it

36
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,944
will be what the algorithm predicts that the label will be.

37
00:01:51,944 --> 00:01:55,340
In this case ŷ is one if the algorithm predicts that the student

38
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,090
gets accepted- which means the point lies over the line,

39
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,159
and ŷ is zero if the algorithm predicts that the student

40
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,864
get rejected- which means the point is under the line.

41
00:02:05,864 --> 00:02:10,620
In math terms, this means that the prediction ŷ is 1 if

42
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:17,465
Wx + b is greater than or equal to zero and 0 if Wx + b is less than zero.

43
00:02:17,465 --> 00:02:20,460
So to summarize, the points above the line have ŷ

44
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,300
equals one and the points below the line have ŷ

45
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:30,319
equals zero and the blue points have y equals one and the red points have y equals zero.

46
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:33,418
And the goal of the algorithm is to have ŷ resembling

47
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:36,419
y as closely as possible- which is exactly

48
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:39,419
equivalent to finding the boundary line that keeps most of

49
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:43,000
the blue points above it and most of the red points below it.
