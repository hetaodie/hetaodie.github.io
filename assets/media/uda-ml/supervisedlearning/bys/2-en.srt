1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,350
We'll start with an example.

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:03,720
Let's say we're in an office and there are two people,

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,964
Alex and Brenda, and they are both there the same amount of time.

4
00:00:07,964 --> 00:00:11,490
One day we're in the office and we see someone passing by really fast.

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,095
We can't tell who it is,

6
00:00:13,095 --> 00:00:14,820
but we'd like to take a guess.

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,844
So far with all we know,

8
00:00:16,844 --> 00:00:21,015
all we can infer is that since they're both in the office the same amount of time,

9
00:00:21,015 --> 00:00:23,370
the probability of the person being Alex is

10
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:28,039
50% and the probability of the person being Brenda is also 50%.

11
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:30,640
But now let's try to use more information so

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,414
we can make a better guess of who the person is.

13
00:00:33,414 --> 00:00:35,575
When we saw the person running by,

14
00:00:35,575 --> 00:00:38,290
we noticed that they were wearing a red sweater,

15
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:40,600
so we'll use that piece of information.

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,850
We've known Alex and Brenda for awhile,

17
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,789
and actually we've noticed that Alex wears a red sweater

18
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:49,539
two days a week and Brenda wears a red sweater three days a week.

19
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:52,524
We don't know which days, but we are sure of this fact.

20
00:00:52,524 --> 00:00:54,460
Also when we say week, we mean work week,

21
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,579
so five days, although at the end this won't matter much.

22
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:00,070
So, now what we'll do is we'll use

23
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,130
this piece of information to help us make a better guess.

24
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,689
First off, since Alex wears a red sweater less than Brenda,

25
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:09,149
it's easy to imagine that it's a bit less likely that

26
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,120
the person we saw is Alex than that it is Brenda.

27
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,859
But exactly how likely?

28
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:17,655
Well, let's say that if we saw a person pass by five times,

29
00:01:17,655 --> 00:01:20,070
it would make sense to think that two of these times it was

30
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:23,287
Alex since he wears a red sweater twice a week,

31
00:01:23,287 --> 00:01:27,239
and the other three times it was Brenda since she wears a red sweater three times a week.

32
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:33,359
Therefore, from here we can infer that the probabilities are 40 and 60.

33
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,629
We've used the information about the color of the sweater to obtain

34
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:40,459
better probabilities about who was the person who passed by.

35
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:44,500
This is Bayes Theorem and we'll learn it more in detail in the next few videos.

36
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,515
The initial guess we had, the 50-50 guess,

37
00:01:47,515 --> 00:01:50,170
is called the prior since it's all we could

38
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:53,680
infer prior to the new information about the red sweater.

39
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,260
The final guess we have, the 60-40 guess,

40
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:01,469
is called the posterior since we've inferred it after the new information has arrived.
