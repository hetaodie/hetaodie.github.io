1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,995
Now, let's look at an interesting application of Bayes Theorem.

2
00:00:02,995 --> 00:00:06,509
Let's say we're not feeling very well and we go to the doctor.

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:09,855
The doctor says, "There's a terrible disease going on,

4
00:00:09,855 --> 00:00:11,595
I'll administer a test for you."

5
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:16,315
Moreover, she says that the test has 99 percent accuracy.

6
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:20,078
More specifically, she says that for every 100 patients that are sick,

7
00:00:20,077 --> 00:00:22,695
the test correctly diagnoses ninety nine of them,

8
00:00:22,695 --> 00:00:25,170
and for every 100 patients that are healthy,

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,929
the test correctly diagnosis 99 of them.

10
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:32,250
If you want to be technical, these are actually called sensitivity and specificity.

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,825
Then while we were waiting for our test,

12
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:36,645
we researched the internet and find that on average,

13
00:00:36,645 --> 00:00:40,650
one of every 10,000 people suffer from the disease.

14
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:43,079
The next day, the doctor calls with terrible news.

15
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,179
She says that we have tested positive for the disease. So now we're panicking.

16
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:50,519
But before panicking, let's turn to math and actually

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,390
calculate what is the probability of being sick. So, here's a quiz.

18
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,649
Given the two pieces of information that the test has

19
00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:02,740
99 percent accuracy and that one out of every 10,000 people have the disease,

20
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,284
what do you think the probability is that we're sick?

21
00:01:06,284 --> 00:01:09,994
Is it from zero to 20 percent, from 20 to 40,

22
00:01:09,995 --> 00:01:12,675
40 to 60, 60 to 80,

23
00:01:12,674 --> 00:01:14,759
or 80 to 100?

24
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,410
Take your guess and enter it.
