1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,439
So, let's see. We have

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,439
three spam emails and one of them contains the word "easy" which means

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,190
the probability of an email containing the word "easy" given that it's spam is one-third.

4
00:00:10,189 --> 00:00:14,449
Since two out of the three spam emails contained the word "money," then the probability

5
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:18,605
of an email containing the word "money" given that it's spam is two-thirds.

6
00:00:18,605 --> 00:00:23,769
And similarly, there are five ham emails and one of them contains the word "easy," then

7
00:00:23,769 --> 00:00:28,980
the probability of an email containing the word "easy" given that it is ham is one-fifth.

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,039
And same thing for the word "money."

9
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,159
And the main gist of Bayesian learning is the following: We go

10
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,399
from what's known which is P of easy given spam,

11
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:39,704
and P of money given spam,

12
00:00:39,704 --> 00:00:45,710
to what's inferred which is P of spam given that it contains the word

13
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,320
"easy" which is one half since there are

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,520
two emails containing the word "easy" and only one of them is spam,

15
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,380
and P of spam given that it contains the word "money" which is

16
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,690
two-thirds since there are three e-mails

17
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:03,469
containing the word "money" and two of them are spam.

18
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:06,194
And now, here's the naive part of my base.

19
00:01:06,194 --> 00:01:10,334
We pretend that these are independent and just multiply them together to obtain

20
00:01:10,334 --> 00:01:12,799
the probability that the email is spam if it

21
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,524
contains the word "easy" and the word "money."

22
00:01:15,525 --> 00:01:17,210
Of course, this is not true in general.

23
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:21,589
But making this assumption normally gives us some pretty good results,

24
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,290
and it's not such a crazy assumption after all.

25
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,140
We'll see this more in detail later.
