00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,669
In the last video, we saw an example of Bayes' theorem,

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:05,969
but here's the main idea of fit and it's a very powerful theorem.

3
00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:11,820
What it does is it switches from what we know to what we infer.

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,835
What we know in this case is the probability that Alex

5
00:00:14,835 --> 00:00:18,425
wears red and the probability that Brenda wears red,

6
00:00:18,425 --> 00:00:20,380
and what we infer is the opposite,

7
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:25,734
is the probability of someone wearing red is Alex or that someone wearing red is Brenda.

8
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,579
In other words, initially,

9
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:29,829
we know the probability of an event, A,

10
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:31,404
and to give us more information,

11
00:00:31,405 --> 00:00:32,740
we introduce a new event,

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,870
R, which is related to A.

13
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:37,439
We know the probability of R given A.

14
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,284
What Bayes' theorem does is, from these two,

15
00:00:40,284 --> 00:00:44,049
it infers the probability of A given R. This

16
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:49,530
is the new probability of A once we know that the event R has occurred.
