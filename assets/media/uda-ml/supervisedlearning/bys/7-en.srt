1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,484
Well, let's see. Let's use Bayes theorem to calculate it.

2
00:00:03,484 --> 00:00:05,134
We'll use the following notation,

3
00:00:05,134 --> 00:00:07,064
S will stand for sick,

4
00:00:07,065 --> 00:00:08,970
H will stand for healthy,

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,740
and the plus sign will stand for testing positive.

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,435
So, since one out of every 10,000 people are sick,

7
00:00:15,435 --> 00:00:20,039
we get that P of S is 0.0001.

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,750
Similarly, P of H is 0.9999.

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,240
Since the test has 99 percent accuracy,

10
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:29,414
both for sick and for healthy patients,

11
00:00:29,414 --> 00:00:34,969
we see that P of plus, given S,

12
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:41,759
is 0.99, the probability that the sick patient will get correctly diagnosed.

13
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:43,399
And that P of plus,

14
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:45,772
given H, is 0.01,

15
00:00:45,773 --> 00:00:50,800
the probability that the healthy patient will get incorrectly diagnosed as sick.

16
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:52,500
So, plugging this into the new formula,

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,960
we get that the probability of being diagnosed as

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,310
positive when you're sick is exactly 0.0098,

19
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,054
which is less than one percent.

20
00:01:02,054 --> 00:01:04,227
Really, less than one percent,

21
00:01:04,227 --> 00:01:06,655
when the test has 99 percent accuracy?

22
00:01:06,655 --> 00:01:10,200
That's strange. But I guess that's the answer to the quiz.

23
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,280
So, less than one percent falls in this category of zero to 20 percent.

24
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,465
I'm still puzzled though,

25
00:01:15,465 --> 00:01:19,704
why less than one percent if the test is correct 99 percent of the time?

26
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:23,310
Well, let's explore. Let's go back to the tree of possibilities.

27
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,844
Let's say we start with one million patients,

28
00:01:25,844 --> 00:01:28,914
and they have two options, healthy and sick.

29
00:01:28,915 --> 00:01:32,068
Now, since one out of every 10,000 patients is sick,

30
00:01:32,067 --> 00:01:34,328
then from this group of one million patients,

31
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:40,680
a hundred will be sick and the remaining 999,900 will be healthy.

32
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,160
Now, let's remember that for every 100 patients,

33
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:47,689
99 get correctly diagnosed and one gets incorrectly diagnosed.

34
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:51,519
This happens both for sick and for healthy patients.

35
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,824
So let's see how many of these patients will get diagnosed positively or negatively.

36
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:57,930
Out of the 100 sick ones,

37
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,505
99 will be correctly diagnosed as

38
00:02:00,504 --> 00:02:05,364
positive and one will be incorrectly diagnosed as negative.

39
00:02:05,364 --> 00:02:06,765
Now, out of the healthy ones,

40
00:02:06,765 --> 00:02:12,780
one percent or 9,999 will be incorrectly diagnosed as positive and

41
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:20,400
the remaining 99 percent or 989,901 will be correctly diagnosed as negative.

42
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,560
Now, let's really examine these four groups.

43
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,414
The first group is the sick people who we will send for more tests or treatment.

44
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:31,889
The second is the unlucky sick people that will be sent home with no treatment.

45
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:37,109
The third is a slightly confused healthy people who will be sent for more tests.

46
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,900
And the fourth group or the majority is the people who are

47
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,849
healthy and were correctly diagnosed healthy and sent home.

48
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:44,439
But now, here's the thing.

49
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:46,125
We know we tested positively,

50
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,919
so we must be among one of these two groups,

51
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:54,764
the sick people who tested positively or the healthy people who tested positively.

52
00:02:54,764 --> 00:02:58,762
One group is much larger and has 9,999 people,

53
00:02:58,763 --> 00:03:01,890
whereas the other one has only 99 people.

54
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:07,349
The probability that we're in this group is much larger than that we're in this group.

55
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:11,609
As a matter of fact, the probability that we are in the small group is

56
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:18,210
99 divided by the sum 99 plus 9,999,

57
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,965
which is, you guessed it,

58
00:03:19,965 --> 00:03:25,479
0.0098, which is smaller than one percent.

59
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:30,804
This is the probability of being sick if you are diagnosed as positive.

60
00:03:30,805 --> 00:03:34,310
But why is the group of healthy people who tested positively so

61
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,939
much larger than the group of sick people who tested positively?

62
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:41,974
The reason is because even though the test only fails one percent of the time,

63
00:03:41,974 --> 00:03:43,759
that one percent is much,

64
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:49,159
much larger than the one out of 10,000 rate of sickness among the population.

65
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:53,254
In other words, in a group of 10,000 healthy people,

66
00:03:53,254 --> 00:03:57,579
one percent or 100 of them will get misdiagnosed as sick.

67
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,575
On the other hand, in a group of 10,000 people,

68
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:04,099
around one will be sick. This is much less.

69
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:06,500
So, if you know you've tested positively,

70
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:12,627
you are still more likely to be among the 100 errors than among the ones sick.

71
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:13,954
And how much more likely?

72
00:04:13,955 --> 00:04:15,235
Around a hundred times.

73
00:04:15,235 --> 00:04:17,480
And that's why our probability of being sick while

74
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,129
being diagnosed positively is around one percent.

75
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:23,209
This phenomenon is called a false positive,

76
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:25,099
and it has been a nightmare for the medical world,

77
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,945
the legal world, and many others.

78
00:04:26,944 --> 00:04:30,439
Search false positives on Google and you'll see many cases

79
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:34,219
in which people have been misdiagnosed, misjudged, etcetera.

80
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,405
So, always be aware of false positives.

81
00:04:36,404 --> 00:04:38,000
They are very sneaky.
