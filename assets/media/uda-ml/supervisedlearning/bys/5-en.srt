1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,745
So, let's look at a formal version of Bayes Theorem.

2
00:00:02,745 --> 00:00:04,875
Initially, we start with an event,

3
00:00:04,875 --> 00:00:07,214
and this event could be A or B.

4
00:00:07,214 --> 00:00:09,330
The probabilities for each are here,

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,419
P of A and P of B.

6
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:14,310
Now we observe a third event,

7
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:18,149
and that event can either happen, or not happen,

8
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:22,320
both for A and for B. R is going to help us

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,120
find more exact probabilities for A and B in the following way.

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,810
Let's say we can calculate the probability of our given A,

11
00:00:31,809 --> 00:00:34,289
and also of R complement,

12
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:37,450
which is not R given A.

13
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,900
And similarly for R given B,

14
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,164
and R complement given B.

15
00:00:42,164 --> 00:00:45,585
Now, our set of scenarios are these four,

16
00:00:45,585 --> 00:00:48,645
R n A, R complement n A,

17
00:00:48,645 --> 00:00:52,370
R n B, and R complement and B.

18
00:00:52,369 --> 00:00:54,584
But since we know R occurred,

19
00:00:54,585 --> 00:00:58,230
then we know that the second and the fourth events are not possible.

20
00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:01,289
So our new universe consists of the two events,

21
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,144
R n A and R n B.

22
00:01:05,144 --> 00:01:08,125
We calculate the probability for A n R,

23
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:12,590
or equivalently A intersection R. And by the Law of Conditional Probability,

24
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,170
this is P F A times B of R given A.

25
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:22,995
Similarly, for B intersection R. And now since these probabilities do not add to one,

26
00:01:22,995 --> 00:01:25,605
we just divide them both by their sum,

27
00:01:25,605 --> 00:01:29,645
so that the new normalized probabilities now do add to one.

28
00:01:29,644 --> 00:01:36,465
Thus, we get the following formulas for P of A given R and P of B given R.

29
00:01:36,465 --> 00:01:43,469
These are our new and improved probabilities for A and B after we know that R occured.

30
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:47,265
Again, B of A and P of B are called the prior probabilities,

31
00:01:47,265 --> 00:01:50,875
which is what we knew before we knew that R occurred.

32
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:55,530
P of A given R and P of B given R are posterior probabilities,

33
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,849
which is what we inferred after we knew that R occurred.

34
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:03,000
And here it is, the formula for Bayes Theorem.
