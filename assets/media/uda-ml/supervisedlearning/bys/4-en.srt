1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,669
Bayes Theorem can get a little more complex.

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:04,365
Let's take a look at a small example,

3
00:00:04,365 --> 00:00:07,804
and what we'll do here is we'll mess a bit with the prior probability.

4
00:00:07,804 --> 00:00:12,855
So, again, we have Alex and Brenda in the office and we saw someone pass by quickly.

5
00:00:12,855 --> 00:00:14,845
And we don't know who the person is.

6
00:00:14,845 --> 00:00:17,580
So let's say we look more carefully at their schedules and we

7
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:21,195
realize that Alex actually works from the office most of the time.

8
00:00:21,195 --> 00:00:23,820
He comes by three days a week.

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,160
And Brenda travels a lot for work so

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,030
she actually comes to the office only one day a week.

11
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,490
So, initially, without knowing anything about the red sweater,

12
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:37,935
all we know is that it's three times more likely to see Alex than to see Brenda.

13
00:00:37,935 --> 00:00:45,429
Therefore, our prior probabilities are 0.75 for Alex and 0.25 for Brenda.

14
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:48,825
And let's say that we have this happening throughout all the weeks.

15
00:00:48,825 --> 00:00:50,859
But now we use our extra knowledge,

16
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:54,030
which is that the person we saw had a red sweater.

17
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,685
The rule is still as before,

18
00:00:55,685 --> 00:00:58,710
as Alex wears red twice a week,

19
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,420
and Brenda wears red three times a week.

20
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:08,135
So, naively, we would think that the real probabilities are not exactly 0.75 or 0.25,

21
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:11,959
because Brenda wears a red sweater more than Alex.

22
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:13,899
So they should be a little closer to each other.

23
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,960
Let's calculate them. So, we'll do the following.

24
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:21,149
Let's think of the columns as weeks instead.

25
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,375
So now, for each five-day work week,

26
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:27,959
Alex wears red twice and Brenda three times.

27
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:30,799
So we color the days they wore red.

28
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,224
Now, since we know the person wore red,

29
00:01:33,224 --> 00:01:35,459
we forget about the times that they didn't.

30
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:38,724
So, we have nine times someone wore red.

31
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:40,140
Six of them are Alex,

32
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,239
and three of them are Brenda.

33
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,530
Therefore, among nine times we saw someone wearing red,

34
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,570
two thirds of the times it was Alex,

35
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:50,625
and one third of the time it was Brenda.

36
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:55,185
Thus, our posterior probabilities are two thirds,

37
00:01:55,185 --> 00:01:57,990
or 0.67, for Alex,

38
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:01,459
and one third, or 0.33, for Brenda.

39
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:03,224
So, it looks like we did a little bit of magic.

40
00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:05,744
Let's do this again in a more mathematical way.

41
00:02:05,745 --> 00:02:06,930
We saw a person,

42
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,080
and initially all we know is that it's Alex with

43
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,170
a 75 percent probability and Brenda with a 25 percent probability,

44
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:19,339
since Alex comes to the office three times a week and Brenda once a week.

45
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,525
But now new information comes to light,

46
00:02:21,525 --> 00:02:24,460
which is that the person is wearing a red sweater,

47
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:29,570
and the data says that Alex wears red two times a week.

48
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:31,049
So, now we look at Alex.

49
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,710
What is the probability that he's wearing red?

50
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:38,955
Since the work week has five days and the probability of him wearing red is two fifths,

51
00:02:38,955 --> 00:02:45,775
or 0.4 and the probability of him not wearing red is the complement, so 0.6.

52
00:02:45,775 --> 00:02:49,689
Same thing with Brenda. Since she wears red three times a week,

53
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:53,668
then the probability of her wearing red today is 0.6,

54
00:02:53,668 --> 00:02:57,250
and the probability of her not wearing red is 0.4.

55
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,664
Now, by the formula of conditional probability,

56
00:03:00,664 --> 00:03:04,784
the probability that these two will happen is the product of the two probabilities,

57
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:08,270
p of Alex, times p of red given Alex.

58
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:12,350
Therefore, the probability of the person we saw is Alex, and that they're wearing red,

59
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:17,245
is precisely 0.75 times 0.4.

60
00:03:17,245 --> 00:03:19,480
We multiply them and put the result here.

61
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:22,039
We calculate the other probabilities in the same way.

62
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:24,699
The probability of the person we saw is Alex and that he's not

63
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:27,777
wearing red is 0.75 times 0.6.

64
00:03:27,777 --> 00:03:30,519
The probability that the person we saw is Brenda and that

65
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,520
she's wearing red is again the product of these probabilities,

66
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,844
which is 0.25 times 0.6.

67
00:03:35,844 --> 00:03:38,919
And finally, the probably of the person we saw is Brenda and that she's

68
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:42,030
not wearing red is 0.25 times 0.4.

69
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,525
And now here's where the Bayesian magic happens. Are you ready?

70
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,469
We have four possible scenarios,

71
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:50,240
and you can check that these four probabilities add to one.

72
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,085
But we know one thing,

73
00:03:52,085 --> 00:03:55,030
that the person we saw was wearing red.

74
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,849
Therefore, out of these four scenarios,

75
00:03:57,849 --> 00:03:59,574
only two are plausible,

76
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:02,659
the two when the person is wearing red.

77
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,620
So, we forget about the other two.

78
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,515
Now, since our new universe consists of only these two scenarios,

79
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,854
then the probabilities should be higher.

80
00:04:10,854 --> 00:04:15,439
But the ratio should still be the same with respect to each other.

81
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,490
This means we need to normalize them, or,

82
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:22,620
equivalently, divide them by something so that they now add to 1.

83
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,810
The thing we should divide them by is the sum of the two.

84
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:31,600
So our new probability of the person being Alex is the top one, namely,

85
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,575
0.75 times 0.4, divided by the sum of the two,

86
00:04:35,574 --> 00:04:37,479
namely, 0.75 times 0.4,

87
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,004
plus 0.25 times 0.6.

88
00:04:40,004 --> 00:04:45,415
This is precisely two thirds, or 0.67.

89
00:04:45,415 --> 00:04:49,170
And now, we can see that the complement is the probability that the person is Brenda,

90
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:52,625
which is one third,or 0.33.

91
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:56,694
If we take Brenda's probability and divide it by the sum of both probabilities,

92
00:04:56,694 --> 00:05:00,305
we can see that we get one third, as desired.

93
00:05:00,305 --> 00:05:04,000
And that's it. That is Bayes theorem at its full potential.
