1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,234
And now, on to apply the Naive Bayes algorithm.

2
00:00:03,234 --> 00:00:05,969
We want to calculate the probability that an email is

3
00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:09,314
spam given that it contains the word easy and money.

4
00:00:09,314 --> 00:00:12,209
And as we briefly stated before, we'll make an assumption.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,520
We'll assume that the product of

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,244
the probabilities that the email is spam if it contains the word

7
00:00:19,245 --> 00:00:22,420
easy times the probability that it's spam if it contains

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,990
the money is the desired probability.

9
00:00:26,989 --> 00:00:31,024
This is a naive assumption because it could be that these two are not independent.

10
00:00:31,024 --> 00:00:33,329
Say, it could be that emails containing the word

11
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:36,420
easy are more likely to contain the word money,

12
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,445
but it turns out that this assumption ends up working really well in many situations.

13
00:00:41,445 --> 00:00:43,350
So we'll make it. And so,

14
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,740
we obtain that the probability of the email being

15
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:52,520
spam is one-half times two-thirds which is one-third.

16
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,690
For clarity, I've written the actual formula for

17
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:58,604
these two calculations using Bayes Theorem that we've done previously.

18
00:00:58,604 --> 00:01:04,920
And these two give us again 0.5 and 0.67 for the posteriors.

19
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,430
So finally, we multiply them and we'll obtain the probability of an email being

20
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,695
spam given that it has the words easy and money is 0.33.

21
00:01:13,694 --> 00:01:15,974
And in general, this is what happens.

22
00:01:15,974 --> 00:01:18,000
Let's say we have n suspicious words,

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,090
for example, easy, money, cheap, et cetera.

24
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,935
These are our conditions,

25
00:01:22,935 --> 00:01:24,475
and when we get a new email,

26
00:01:24,474 --> 00:01:25,905
we test against them.

27
00:01:25,905 --> 00:01:30,150
So, we make the naive assumption that the probability of spam given

28
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,700
that the email contains all these words is the product of these probabilities.

29
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,390
And how do we calculate each one of them?

30
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,000
Easy, using Bayes Theorem.
