1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Now, the question is, "How do we use this wonderful base theorem to do machine learning?"

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,629
And the answer is, repeatedly.

3
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:08,654
Let's look at this example,

4
00:00:08,654 --> 00:00:10,980
a spam email classifier.

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,190
So, let's say we have some data in the form of a bunch of emails.

6
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:17,864
Some of them are spam, and some of them are not spam, which we call ham.

7
00:00:17,864 --> 00:00:19,875
Spam are, "win money now,

8
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,495
make cash easy, et cetera."

9
00:00:21,495 --> 00:00:23,100
And the ham are "How are you?,

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,735
There you are, et cetera."

11
00:00:24,734 --> 00:00:27,000
And now, what we'll do is,

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,414
when a new email comes in and say,

13
00:00:29,414 --> 00:00:33,060
"Easy money," and we want to check if it's spam or ham.

14
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,800
So we take it word by word.

15
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:37,559
Of course, we can be more effective if we took into

16
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,085
account the order of the words but for this classifier, we won't.

17
00:00:41,085 --> 00:00:43,350
It's surprising how good it can be even if it

18
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,885
doesn't take into account the order of the words.

19
00:00:45,884 --> 00:00:48,284
So let's study the first word, say, easy.

20
00:00:48,284 --> 00:00:52,169
We can see the word easy appears once among the three spam emails,

21
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,125
and once among the five ham emails.

22
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:59,115
And the word money, it appears twice among the three spam emails,

23
00:00:59,115 --> 00:01:01,515
and ones among the five ham emails.

24
00:01:01,515 --> 00:01:05,250
So let's start with calculating some preliminary probabilities as an exercise.

25
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,915
Given the data we have,

26
00:01:06,915 --> 00:01:11,589
what is the probability of an email containing the word easy given that it is spam?

27
00:01:11,588 --> 00:01:13,504
Here are some options.

28
00:01:13,504 --> 00:01:16,204
And let's also calculate it for the other word.

29
00:01:16,204 --> 00:01:17,329
Again, given our data,

30
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:23,719
what's the probability of an email being spam given that it contains the word money?

31
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:26,400
Here are the options, enter your answer below
