1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,714
So, let's do this calculation a bit more in detail.

2
00:00:02,714 --> 00:00:04,769
Since we have eight emails in total,

3
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:08,250
and three of them are spam and five of them are non-spam,

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,775
or ham, than our prior probabilities are

5
00:00:11,775 --> 00:00:15,960
three over eight for spam and five over eight for ham.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,839
So, on to calculate the posteriors.

7
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:20,670
Say we have a spam email.

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,140
Since there are three of them,

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,050
and one contains the word easy and two don't,

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,080
then the probability for containing the word easy is one-third and

11
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,099
for not containing it is two-thirds, if you're spam.

12
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,635
And as we've calculated before,

13
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:37,049
the probability of containing the word easy,

14
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:39,239
if you're ham, is one-fifth,

15
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,920
and of not containing,

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,480
if you're ham, is four-fifths.

17
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,269
Now, by the rule of conditional probabilities,

18
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,130
the probability that an email is spam and contains

19
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,160
the word easy is the product of these two,

20
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:52,619
three over eight times one third, which is one-eighth.

21
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:55,229
In a similar way, we calculated the probability of being

22
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:58,184
spam and not containing the word easy, which is one-fourth,

23
00:00:58,185 --> 00:01:02,070
and the probabilities of being ham and containing the word easy is one-eighth,

24
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,140
and not containing it is one-half.

25
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,599
Now, this is where we apply Bayes rule.

26
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,609
We know that the email contains the word easy,

27
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:12,536
so our entire universe consists of only these two two cases,

28
00:01:12,536 --> 00:01:14,299
when the email is spam or ham.

29
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:17,704
Those two have the same probability, one-eighth, of happening.

30
00:01:17,704 --> 00:01:19,700
So, once we normalize the probabilities,

31
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,043
they both turn into 50 percent,

32
00:01:23,043 --> 00:01:27,110
thus our two posterior probabilities are 50 percent.

33
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:29,045
For ham emails, we can do the same procedure.

34
00:01:29,045 --> 00:01:33,650
Our priors are three over eight and five over eight, as before.

35
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,869
Our probabilities of containing the word money,

36
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:36,950
and not containing it,

37
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,740
are two-thirds and one-third for the spam emails,

38
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:43,084
and one-fifth and four-fifths for the ham emails.

39
00:01:43,084 --> 00:01:46,522
Our products of probabilities are then one-quarter,

40
00:01:46,522 --> 00:01:49,890
one-quarter, one-eighth, and one-half.

41
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,275
But since the email contains the word money,

42
00:01:52,275 --> 00:01:54,300
then we only care about these two.

43
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,140
Since one-fourth is twice as much as one-eighth,

44
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,765
when we normalize them we get two-thirds,

45
00:02:00,765 --> 00:02:03,420
or 66.7% for spam,

46
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,945
and one-third, or 33.3% for ham.

47
00:02:06,944 --> 00:02:10,000
These are the posteriors.
