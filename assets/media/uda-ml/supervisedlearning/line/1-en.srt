00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,093
So let's say we're studying the housing market,

2
00:00:02,093 --> 00:00:05,990
and our task is to predict the price of a house given its size.

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:12,895
So we have a small house that costs $70,000 and a big house that costs $160,000.

4
00:00:12,895 --> 00:00:17,220
We'd like to estimate the price of this medium-sized house over here.

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,775
So how do we do it?

6
00:00:18,775 --> 00:00:23,460
Well, first we put them in a grid where the x-axis represents the size of

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,200
the house in square feet and the y-axis represents the price of the house.

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:35,000
And to help us out, we have collected some previous data in the form of these blue dots.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,780
These are other houses that we've looked at and we've

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,800
recorded their prices with respect to their size.

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:47,575
In here, we can see that small house is priced at $70,000 and the big one at $160,000.

12
00:00:47,575 --> 00:00:49,405
Now, it's time for a small quiz.

13
00:00:49,405 --> 00:00:56,365
What do you think is the best estimate for the price of the medium house given this data?

14
00:00:56,365 --> 00:00:59,029
Would it be $80,000,

15
00:00:59,029 --> 00:01:03,030
$120,000, or $190,000?

16
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,680
Submit your answer.
