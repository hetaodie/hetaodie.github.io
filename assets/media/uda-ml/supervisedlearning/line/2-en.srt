00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
Well, to help us out,

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,929
we can see that these points can form a line.

3
00:00:04,929 --> 00:00:09,089
And we can draw the line that best fits this data.

4
00:00:09,089 --> 00:00:11,460
Now, on this line, we can see that our best guess for

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,580
the price of the house is this point here over the line,

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,750
which corresponds to $120,000.

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,274
So, if you said $120,000, that is correct.

8
00:00:22,274 --> 00:00:25,859
This method is known as linear regression.

9
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,839
You can think of linear regression as a painter,

10
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:31,920
who will look at your data and draw the best-fitting line through it.

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,664
And you may ask, how do we find this line?

12
00:00:34,664 --> 00:00:37,000
Well, that's what the rest of the section will be about.
