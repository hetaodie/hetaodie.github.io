1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,129
So what happens if we have data that looks like this,

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:04,639
where a line won't really do a good job fitting it?

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:07,709
Maybe we would like to have a curve or some polynomial?

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,434
Maybe something along the lines of 2x cubed minus 8x squared, et cetera.

5
00:00:12,435 --> 00:00:15,894
This can be solved using a very similar algorithm than linear regression.

6
00:00:15,894 --> 00:00:18,254
All we have to do is, instead of considering lines,

7
00:00:18,254 --> 00:00:21,210
we consider higher degree polynomials.

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,105
This would give us more ways to solve our problem.

9
00:00:23,105 --> 00:00:26,039
For example, this problem here will make us solve for four weights,

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,324
w1, w2, w3 and w4.

11
00:00:29,324 --> 00:00:31,829
But the algorithm is the same thing.

12
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:35,729
We just take the mean absolute or squared error and take the derivative the respect to

13
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:37,890
the four variables and use gradient descent to

14
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,399
modify these four weights in order to minimize the error.

15
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,000
This algorithm is known as polynomial regression.
