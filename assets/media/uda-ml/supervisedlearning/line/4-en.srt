00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,474
So let's have a little refresher on how we move lines by changing the parameters.

2
00:00:04,474 --> 00:00:06,019
So if we have a line of equation,

3
00:00:06,019 --> 00:00:08,160
y = W1x + W2,

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,002
where W1 and W2 are constants,

5
00:00:11,002 --> 00:00:15,765
it looks like this: W1 is the slope and W2 is the y-intercept,

6
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:18,855
which is where the line intersects the y-axis.

7
00:00:18,855 --> 00:00:22,010
Now, what happens if we increase W1?

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,800
Well, we increase the slope so that means the line rotates like this.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,300
If we decrease W1, then we're decreasing the slope so the line rotates like this.

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,869
Now, what happens if we increase the y-intercept W2?

11
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:37,140
Then, the line moves in a parallel way up like this.

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,640
If we decrease W2,

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,960
then the line moves like that to the bottom.

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,259
That's really all we're going to need for the tricks that are coming.
