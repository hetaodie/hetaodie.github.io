1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,745
So, here is another trick that will help us move a point closer to a line,

2
00:00:03,745 --> 00:00:05,754
and is very similar to the Absolute Trick,

3
00:00:05,754 --> 00:00:08,144
but it has a little bit of extra grading.

4
00:00:08,144 --> 00:00:09,285
It is based on the premise,

5
00:00:09,285 --> 00:00:11,580
if we have a point that is close to a line,

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,484
then this distance is small,

7
00:00:13,484 --> 00:00:16,750
and we want to move the line very little.

8
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,320
But if the point is far from the line,

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,980
then we want to move the line a lot more.

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,140
The absolute trick that we'll learned previously does not

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,495
have this property because if we remember,

12
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:34,079
the absolute trick adds alpha to the y-intercept W2 and p times alpha to the slope W1.

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,570
This has nothing to do with how far the point is from

14
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,435
the line since p is just the horizontal distance.

15
00:00:39,435 --> 00:00:42,265
So let's just add the vertical distance to this formula.

16
00:00:42,265 --> 00:00:45,134
Let's look at this vertical distance between the point and the line.

17
00:00:45,134 --> 00:00:46,949
The distance is q minus y,

18
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,950
because y is the value of the line and q is the value of the y-coordinate at the point.

19
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,804
So what we do here is very simple.

20
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:57,030
We just take this q minus y and multiply it into what we

21
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,719
are adding to both the y-intercept and to the slope.

22
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,619
This will again make the line go up by a bit and rotate in

23
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:07,734
the direction except that now if the point is far from or close to the line,

24
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,709
the amount the line moves will be affected.

25
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:14,084
And here's our new equation with a factor of q minus y.

26
00:01:14,084 --> 00:01:16,119
Notice that here, we get something for free.

27
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,885
If the point is underneath the line instead of over the line,

28
00:01:18,885 --> 00:01:21,609
then q minus y is actually a negative value.

29
00:01:21,609 --> 00:01:24,980
And if this is the case, then we're subtracting something from the slope,

30
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:29,400
thus rotating the line in this direction instead still towards the point.

31
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,020
So this trick also takes care of points that are under the line

32
00:01:32,019 --> 00:01:35,435
and we don't have to have two rules like we had on the absolute trick.

33
00:01:35,435 --> 00:01:37,820
We just have one rule for both.

34
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:40,179
And again, let's clarify this with an example.

35
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,340
In this example over here,

36
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,115
we have the point 5,15.

37
00:01:43,114 --> 00:01:47,280
And notice that this distance is going to be two because the line goes to

38
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,519
the point 5,13 as two times five plus three, is 13.

39
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,575
Now, to change things a bit,

40
00:01:53,575 --> 00:01:56,280
we'll use 0.01 as our learning rate.

41
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,969
So with the absolute trick, we'd be adding 0.01 to the y-intercept and 0.05 to the slope.

42
00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:03,870
But now, as our new trick sets,

43
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:08,810
we multiply the two numbers that we're adding to the slope and to the y-intercept by two,

44
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:14,545
which means we're adding 0.1 to the slope and 0.02 to the y-intercept.

45
00:02:14,544 --> 00:02:18,369
So the equation of our new line is Y equals 2.1X plus

46
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,969
3.02 and that line is going to be closer to the point.

47
00:02:22,969 --> 00:02:25,000
So that's it. That's the Square Trick.
