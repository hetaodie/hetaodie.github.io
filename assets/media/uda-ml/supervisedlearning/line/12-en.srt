1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,610
Well that was a tricky quiz.

2
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:03,570
If you said the same, then you were correct.

3
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:04,589
Because as you can see,

4
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:08,969
moving this line up and down actually keeps the mean absolute error of the same.

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,190
You can convince yourself by looking at the picture and

6
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:13,593
checking that as you move a line up and down,

7
00:00:13,593 --> 00:00:16,320
you're adding a segment to two of the errors and

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,214
removing a segment of equal length to the other two errors.

9
00:00:20,214 --> 00:00:21,324
Now let's repeat the quiz,

10
00:00:21,324 --> 00:00:22,934
but with the mean squared error.

11
00:00:22,934 --> 00:00:25,679
The question is, which one of these three lines A, B,

12
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:28,605
and C, would give us a smaller mean square error?

13
00:00:28,605 --> 00:00:30,000
And to your answer below.
