1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,150
So, this time there was a solution and the solution is B.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,375
And here is the reason which is more subtle.

3
00:00:06,375 --> 00:00:08,324
Our mean squared error,

4
00:00:08,324 --> 00:00:10,139
is actually a quadratic function.

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,800
And quadratic functions have a minimum at the point in the middle.

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,839
Over here, we can see that the error for line A would be around here,

7
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:20,035
the error for line C would be around here,

8
00:00:20,035 --> 00:00:23,000
and the one for line B would be somewhere around here.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,234
So, we can see that the minimum mean square error is given by line B.

10
00:00:27,234 --> 00:00:28,704
Here is a diagram of the errors,

11
00:00:28,704 --> 00:00:29,799
and you can check with your eyes,

12
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,384
or even drawing a small example in calculating the areas.

13
00:00:32,384 --> 00:00:36,000
That line B would be giving you the smallest mean square error.
