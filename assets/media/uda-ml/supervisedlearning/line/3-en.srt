00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,125
So here's a trick that will help us fit a line through a set of points.

2
00:00:04,125 --> 00:00:08,390
Let's say that these are points and we start by drawing some random line.

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,040
And we're going to ask every point what it

4
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:14,399
wants for the model to be better, and then listen to them.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,144
So let's go one by one.

6
00:00:16,144 --> 00:00:17,939
Let's take this point over here,

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,125
and ask it what would it want the line to do.

8
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:24,545
Well, the point would want the line to move closer.

9
00:00:24,545 --> 00:00:27,480
So we'll listen to that point and move closer.

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,423
Now if we ask all the points,

11
00:00:29,423 --> 00:00:31,035
they would tell us the same thing.

12
00:00:31,035 --> 00:00:32,923
So we move closer to all of them,.

13
00:00:32,923 --> 00:00:36,984
Then we listen to them again and we take another step that gets closer to all of them.

14
00:00:36,984 --> 00:00:38,609
Now it's trickier because we have a point

15
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:41,240
underneath that pulls it down, but that's still okay.

16
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,170
And basically, the idea is that we take

17
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,289
a few steps that make us go closer to all the points.

18
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:48,460
And that's it, that's linear regression.

19
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,280
In the next few videos, we'll see this in a bit more detail.
