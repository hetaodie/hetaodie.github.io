1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
So, here's the question. What is better,

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,564
the mean absolute error or the mean squared error?

3
00:00:05,565 --> 00:00:07,200
Well, there's no real answer to this.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,234
Both are used for a lot of different purposes.

5
00:00:09,234 --> 00:00:12,269
But here's one property that actually tears them apart.

6
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:14,519
So, here's a set of data and we're going to try to

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,675
fit it by minimizing the mean absolute error.

8
00:00:17,675 --> 00:00:20,969
So, let's say we have line A, line B,

9
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:24,044
and line C, and the question is,

10
00:00:24,045 --> 00:00:28,160
which one of these lines gives us a smaller mean absolute error?

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,510
Enter your answer below.
