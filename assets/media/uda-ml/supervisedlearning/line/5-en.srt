1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,064
So, here's our first trick to move a line

2
00:00:02,064 --> 00:00:04,814
closer to a point that we're going to use in linear regression.

3
00:00:04,815 --> 00:00:06,285
It's called the absolute trick,

4
00:00:06,285 --> 00:00:07,740
and it works like this.

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,755
We start with a point and a line.

6
00:00:10,755 --> 00:00:15,230
And the idea is that the point wants the line to come closer to it.

7
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,205
So let's put some numbers here.

8
00:00:17,204 --> 00:00:19,939
The point has coordinates p,q where p is

9
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,070
a horizontal coordinate and q is the vertical coordinate.

10
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,810
And the line has equation Y equals W1X plus W2.

11
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:32,324
And here, W1 is to slope and W2 is the Y-intercept.

12
00:00:32,325 --> 00:00:34,920
So, an easy way to move the line closer to the point

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,590
p,q is to just add one to the Y-intercept,

14
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,720
and then there it is. The line moves up.

15
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,615
And now let's add something to the slope, too,

16
00:00:41,615 --> 00:00:44,600
to make the line rotate in the direction of the point.

17
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,899
This is going to look a little strange,

18
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,879
but it's going to make sense very soon.

19
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,130
So, this distance over here is p because it is

20
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,580
the horizontal distance from the Y-axis to the point.

21
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,869
So let's just add that, let's add p to the slope.

22
00:00:55,869 --> 00:00:59,129
And now, our new slope is W1 plus p,

23
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,590
and that rotates a line in this direction.

24
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:08,075
Now, our new equation is Y equals W1 plus times X plus W2 plus one.

25
00:01:08,075 --> 00:01:10,435
And that's pretty much what the absolute trick is about.

26
00:01:10,435 --> 00:01:11,935
Notice some subtleties though.

27
00:01:11,935 --> 00:01:13,950
Notice that we move the line a little too much,

28
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,875
and we actually went over the point and kept going.

29
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:19,319
We don't want this. In general in machine learning,

30
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:21,599
we never want to take big steps like this.

31
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:24,625
Instead, what want to do is take tiny steps.

32
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:26,310
So, in order to take a tiny step,

33
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,210
what we'll do we exact same thing we did except we multiply everything by a small number.

34
00:01:31,209 --> 00:01:34,859
So let's take a small number called a learning rate, let's say alpha,

35
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:39,739
and instead of adding one to the Y-intercept and p to the slope,

36
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:46,229
we will add alpha times one to the Y-intercept and alpha times p to the slope.

37
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,255
Now the line moves up by a little bit and rotates a little bit,

38
00:01:49,254 --> 00:01:51,554
so we don't have that risk of going too far.

39
00:01:51,555 --> 00:01:58,430
And our new equation is going to be W1 plus p times alpha times X plus W2 plus alpha.

40
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,230
So, our new slope is W1 plus p times alpha,

41
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,870
and our new Y-intercept is W2 plus alpha.

42
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,040
So we're doing better, but there's still little subtlety.

43
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,770
What happens if the point is not on top of the line but underneath the line?

44
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,985
Well, same thing, except now instead of adding,

45
00:02:11,985 --> 00:02:14,640
we just subtract to get our new equation,

46
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:20,159
W1 minus p times alpha times X plus W2 minus alpha.

47
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:22,859
The reason is, if we subtract alpha to the Y-intercept,

48
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,375
the line moves down instead of up,

49
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:26,669
and if we subtract p times alpha to the slope,

50
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:28,289
the line rotates in this direction instead.

51
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:30,569
Something even more interesting is this,

52
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:33,000
and that would explain the reason p is there,

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,465
if the point is not on the right of the Y-axis but on the left of it,

54
00:02:36,465 --> 00:02:40,175
then we still add one to the Y-intercept because we need the line to move up.

55
00:02:40,175 --> 00:02:42,390
But the fact that now we're adding p to the slope,

56
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:44,609
and p is now a negative number,

57
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,030
means that our line now rotates in this direction.

58
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,585
So, that's a reason for p to be there.

59
00:02:49,585 --> 00:02:51,145
Another reason for p to be there is this.

60
00:02:51,145 --> 00:02:53,945
Check this out, if this distance is small,

61
00:02:53,945 --> 00:02:57,504
then p is small, so we're adding a small number to the slope.

62
00:02:57,504 --> 00:02:59,329
Now, if the distances is larger,

63
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:02,505
then p is large, so we're adding a large number to the slope.

64
00:03:02,504 --> 00:03:05,474
And it makes sense that if the point is really close to the Y-axis,

65
00:03:05,474 --> 00:03:07,430
we want to increase the slope by a little bit,

66
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,360
whereas if it's far, we want to move it by a lot more.

67
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,810
So let's do an example to make this more clear.

68
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,280
Let's say we have the point 0.5,15 and the line Y equals 2X plus three.

69
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,265
So this means the distance from the point to the Y-axis is five.

70
00:03:21,264 --> 00:03:24,149
Now, let's say our learning rate is 0.1.

71
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,765
So we're adding 0.1 times one to the Y-intercept,

72
00:03:27,764 --> 00:03:30,689
and that moves the line up by a little bit.

73
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:33,479
Also, we're taking the five, multiplying it by 0.1

74
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,099
and adding that to the slope which makes the line move in this direction.

75
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:43,109
This means the new equation is Y equals 2.5X plus 3.1.

76
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,720
Now check out what happens if the point is in the left.

77
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:49,794
We're still adding 0.1 to the Y-intercept to move the line up.

78
00:03:49,794 --> 00:03:51,509
But now to the slope,

79
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:57,030
we're going to add the point of 0.1 and minus five, that's minus 0.5.

80
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:03,539
This means our new equation is going to be 1.5X plus 3.1.

81
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:05,310
As you can see, the slope moved in

82
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,259
a different direction which made it go closer to the point.

83
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:10,144
So that's it. That's the absolute trick.

84
00:04:10,145 --> 00:04:13,000
And we're going to use it extensively in linear regression.
