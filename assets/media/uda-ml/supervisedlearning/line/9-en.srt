1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,899
Now in this video, we'll learn the Mean Squared Error.

2
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:06,080
The Mean Squared Error is very similar to the Mean Absolute Error.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,960
Again, here we have our point and our prediction.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,470
But now, instead of taking the distance,

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,035
we're actually going to draw a square with this segment as its side.

6
00:00:13,035 --> 00:00:16,995
So the area is precisely y minus y hat squared.

7
00:00:16,995 --> 00:00:18,365
Notice that this is always non-negative,

8
00:00:18,364 --> 00:00:20,709
so we don't need to worry about absolute values.

9
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,740
And our Mean squared Error is going to be the average of all these series of squares,

10
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:28,619
and we're going to have this extra factor of one-half for convenience later.

11
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,050
So in summary, the error is one-half times the average

12
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,225
of the sum of all y minus y hat square.

13
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:36,969
Again, we can take the sum and call it the Total Square Error.

14
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:41,004
But we take the average and this won't make a difference in the algorithm.

15
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:44,160
And notice, if the point is over the line or underneath the line,

16
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:46,919
the square is always going to be in a non-negative number because

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,789
the square of a real number is always going to be non-negative.

18
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:53,280
The one-half is going to be there for convenience because later,

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,564
we'll be taking the derivative of this error.

20
00:00:55,564 --> 00:00:57,809
Again, we can multiply this error by any constant and

21
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,539
the process of minimizing it will be the exact same thing.

22
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:03,405
So this one-half does not affect anything.

23
00:01:03,405 --> 00:01:05,900
So here's a pictorial representation of the error.

24
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,115
Here we have our points, our line,

25
00:01:08,114 --> 00:01:12,334
and the error is the average of the areas of all these squares.

26
00:01:12,334 --> 00:01:13,969
And here's our graph of the error.

27
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:15,599
As we descend from this mountain,

28
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:18,899
we get to the place where the error is the smallest possible and that's the same

29
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,500
as minimizing the average of the areas of the squares.
