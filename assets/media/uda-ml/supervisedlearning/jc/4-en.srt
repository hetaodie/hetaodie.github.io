1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,815
Okay, so let's do some math.

2
00:00:01,815 --> 00:00:05,279
Let's assign to each data point an initial weight of one.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,259
Now, let's fit our first learner.

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:10,455
Before, we wanted to minimize the number of errors.

5
00:00:10,455 --> 00:00:15,765
Now, we want to minimize the sum of weights of the incorrectly classified points which,

6
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:17,640
as of now, is the same.

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,365
So, here is the model.

8
00:00:19,364 --> 00:00:22,664
If we add the weights of the correctly classified points,

9
00:00:22,664 --> 00:00:24,780
we get a seven,

10
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,850
and three for the incorrectly classified points.

11
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,405
So, let's weight the incorrectly classified points a bit more.

12
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:35,905
How much? Well, let's make it enough to have this model be a 50-50 model.

13
00:00:35,905 --> 00:00:38,259
So if we take these three points and weight them by

14
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:41,469
a factor of seven over three, or 2.33,

15
00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:43,869
then our model now has seven as the sum

16
00:00:43,869 --> 00:00:46,239
of the weights of the correctly classified points,

17
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,679
and also seven as the sum of the weights of the incorrectly classified points.

18
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:53,979
So, this model now is lame, and we need a second one.

19
00:00:53,979 --> 00:00:56,229
And our second model will be this one,

20
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:58,884
which fits the newly weighted data best.

21
00:00:58,884 --> 00:01:03,609
For this one, we can see that if we add the weights on the correctly classified points,

22
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:08,140
we get 11, and for the incorrectly classified ones, we get three again.

23
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,719
So, let's weigh the incorrectly classified points.

24
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:15,265
By how much? Well, enough to make this model a 50-50 model again.

25
00:01:15,265 --> 00:01:17,439
Notice that if we weigh these three errors,

26
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,569
each one by a factor of 11 over three,

27
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:25,989
or 3.66, now the sum of the weights of the incorrectly classified points is 11.

28
00:01:25,989 --> 00:01:30,265
So, our model is just a 50-50 model again. That's lame.

29
00:01:30,265 --> 00:01:33,715
Let's fit a third model in this newly weighted data.

30
00:01:33,715 --> 00:01:35,950
And here's our third model.

31
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:39,370
Now what is the added weight of the correctly classified points?

32
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:42,835
Now it's 19, and still three for the incorrect ones.

33
00:01:42,834 --> 00:01:45,574
We can keep this going, but let's stop.

34
00:01:45,575 --> 00:01:47,734
We have built three models.

35
00:01:47,734 --> 00:01:49,579
And here are the three models,

36
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:51,844
or weak learners, that we built.

37
00:01:51,844 --> 00:01:55,400
In the next video, we will learn how to combine them.
