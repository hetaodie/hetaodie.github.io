1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,649
Boosting, as we saw before,

2
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:02,924
is a bit more elaborate.

3
00:00:02,924 --> 00:00:08,039
There are a few ways to do it but one of the most popular is this algorithm, AdaBoost,

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,189
discovered by Freund and Schapire in 1996,

5
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:12,824
and here's the gist of it,

6
00:00:12,824 --> 00:00:15,989
although we'll develop the math in a bit more detail later.

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,839
I must say, if you look at it in the literature,

8
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:20,445
you may find that a bit different.

9
00:00:20,445 --> 00:00:23,100
But I promise you, aside from trivial things like

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,640
multiplying all the weights by its constants which won't change the outcome,

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,789
what I'll be showing you with the exact same Adaboost algorithm.

12
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:32,850
The idea is the following: we fit our first learner in order to

13
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,750
maximize accuracy or equivalently minimize the number of errors.

14
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,679
There's so few good ones but one can check that we can do no better than three errors,

15
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:42,914
so let's fit it and this is the model.

16
00:00:42,914 --> 00:00:44,850
We'll remember this model for later.

17
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,020
Now, our second learner needs to fix on the mistakes that this one has made.

18
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,880
So what we'll do is we'll take the misclassified points and make them bigger.

19
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,365
In other words, we'll punish the model more if it misses these points.

20
00:00:58,365 --> 00:01:01,335
So, the next weak learner needs to focus on these more.

21
00:01:01,335 --> 00:01:05,670
Our second weak learner will be this one which correctly classifies these points.

22
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,685
We'll remember this form for later.

23
00:01:07,685 --> 00:01:10,480
Now again, we punish the points that are misclassified

24
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,525
by this one by enlarging these points over here.

25
00:01:13,525 --> 00:01:17,080
On our third weak learner is this one which tries really

26
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:20,920
hard to correctly classify the big points. We'll remember this one.

27
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,114
Now, we can keep going but let's say three is enough.

28
00:01:24,114 --> 00:01:26,649
Now, we want to combine these models,

29
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,140
and I'll be more specific about combining the later.

30
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,590
But for now, let's imagine that we're making them both like before.

31
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,780
So, our resulting model is this,

32
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,280
which when we fit in the data,

33
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,515
we realize it fits it very well.

34
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,379
So as I said, I was a bit vague on the details,

35
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:44,329
but let me be more specific in the next few videos.
