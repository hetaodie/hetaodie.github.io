1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,285
So now, we can calculate the weights of all our weak learners.

2
00:00:03,285 --> 00:00:05,040
Let's remember that in the first one,

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,339
the sum of weights of the correctly classified points is seven,

4
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:10,574
and the sum of incorrect ones is three.

5
00:00:10,574 --> 00:00:17,640
Therefore, the weight is natural logarithm of seven divided by three, which is 0.84.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,990
For the second one, the sum of weights of the correctly classified points is 11,

7
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:24,119
and for the incorrect ones it's three.

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:29,910
So the weight is natural logarithm of 11 over three, which is 1.3.

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,829
And finally, for the third one,

10
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:33,975
the sum of correct weights is 19,

11
00:00:33,975 --> 00:00:36,325
and for the incorrect ones it's three again.

12
00:00:36,325 --> 00:00:42,740
So the weight is natural logarithm of 19 divided by three, or 1.84.

13
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,190
It sounds like the weights are increasing but don't get the wrong idea.

14
00:00:46,189 --> 00:00:48,320
That only happens in this example.

15
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,109
In general, they will not necessarily be increasing.

16
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:54,769
So now, we have our three week learners with their corresponding weights of

17
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:59,660
0.84, 1.3, and 1.84.

18
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,909
And to combine them, basically,

19
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:06,349
we make them vote, except we weight the vote by the corresponding weight.

20
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:09,454
So for the positive area, we'll add the weight,

21
00:01:09,454 --> 00:01:10,745
and for the negative area,

22
00:01:10,745 --> 00:01:13,380
we'll subtract the weight. So let's do it.

23
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:18,149
We take the first model and add the positives and negatives of the weight to each region,

24
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,925
then we do the same thing with the second model,

25
00:01:20,924 --> 00:01:23,730
and finally, with the third model.

26
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:27,615
And we calculate the sums which gives us these values.

27
00:01:27,614 --> 00:01:29,924
And finally, when the value is positive,

28
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:33,060
then we say blue, and when it is negative, we say red.

29
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,299
And that's it. That's the combination of our weak learners.

30
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,864
And we can see how it forms a strong learner.

31
00:01:38,864 --> 00:01:41,729
We can see that this model fits the data pretty well.

32
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,130
And that's it. That's AdaBoost.
