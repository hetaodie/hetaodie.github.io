1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,935
And yes, it's easy to think.

2
00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's forget about the one that always lies.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,424
And in real life, maybe that's a good thing.

4
00:00:06,424 --> 00:00:09,820
But in here, we could really get good information out of this one.

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,205
What if we ask this friend a lot of yes/no questions.

6
00:00:13,205 --> 00:00:15,320
Well, we'll always get the wrong answers,

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,280
so all we have to do is do the exact opposite.

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,625
In this way, the complete liar gives us a lot of information.

9
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:26,100
In contrast, the one who lies half of the time doesn't really help

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,200
us much since we have no idea if we should believe them or not.

11
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:33,195
And obviously, the truthful one is super helpful, too.

12
00:00:33,195 --> 00:00:37,079
So, we conclude that the worst one is this one in the middle.

13
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,299
In the same way, we'll have our three models.

14
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:41,099
Model one is the truthful one,

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,750
which is always correct.

16
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,979
Model two is the random one,

17
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:45,869
which is correct roughly half of the time.

18
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:49,144
And model three is a liar, which is always wrong.

19
00:00:49,145 --> 00:00:53,760
So, what we'll do is we'll assign the truthful model a large positive weight,

20
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,179
the random model a weight of zero since it's useless,

21
00:00:57,179 --> 00:00:58,469
and the liar model

22
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:03,589
a large negative weight since we'll do the exact opposite as this model says.

23
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:06,659
So, here's a bit of math. We have our number line and

24
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,304
we want our weight function to look like this.

25
00:01:10,305 --> 00:01:13,520
Super positive for the truthful models,

26
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:15,524
zero for the useless models,

27
00:01:15,525 --> 00:01:18,580
and super negative for the liar models.

28
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,609
Let's remember how the models look.

29
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:22,319
They look like this.

30
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:23,909
And let's look at the accuracy.

31
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,584
The truthful model has accuracy around one,

32
00:01:26,584 --> 00:01:29,619
the random model has accuracy around 50 percent,

33
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,520
and the liar model has accurate around zero.

34
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:35,250
So this function will help us check it out.

35
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,275
Y equals natural logarithm of x divided by one over x,

36
00:01:40,275 --> 00:01:42,930
where x is the accuracy.

37
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,725
Check this out. It's very negative for values close to zero.

38
00:01:46,724 --> 00:01:50,189
For 0.5, it's logarithm of 0.5 divide by 0.5,

39
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:53,120
which is logarithm of one, which is zero.

40
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,905
And finally, is very positive for values close to one.

41
00:01:56,905 --> 00:01:59,460
There are actually much heavier mathematical reasons for this

42
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:02,409
to be the function but that's outside the scope of this course.

43
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:03,869
In the instructor comments,

44
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,730
we'll link some reading material including

45
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:09,435
the original paper by Froyin and Shapir, if you're curious.

46
00:02:09,435 --> 00:02:12,120
And if your head is spinning and your alarms are going off because

47
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,670
you saw potential division by zero, don't worry.

48
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:16,344
We'll deal with that in a bit.

49
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:19,724
So, we conclude that a great formula for weight is this.

50
00:02:19,724 --> 00:02:24,340
Natural logarithm of accuracy divided by one minus accuracy.

51
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:28,930
So, a small quiz. Can you find the weights for these three models over here?
