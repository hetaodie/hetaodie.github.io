1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
Now, in order to combine models,

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,269
we'll actually weigh them by how well they're doing.

3
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:09,625
In this way, if one of our friends just answer the questions better,

4
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:11,580
we'll believe that friend more.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,699
So, let's turn into a hypothetical question.

6
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:15,129
We have three friends.

7
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,339
One always tells the truth,

8
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:21,149
the other one tells the truth half of the time and lies half of the time,

9
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:22,769
and we don't know which half,

10
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:25,134
and the third one always lies.

11
00:00:25,135 --> 00:00:30,505
The question is, which one of these three is the one that we should ignore the most?

12
00:00:30,504 --> 00:00:32,159
Equivalently, here, we have three models.

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,109
The first one is always correct,

14
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:36,390
the second one is correct half of the time,

15
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,655
and the third one is wrong every single time.

16
00:00:39,655 --> 00:00:42,429
Which of these models is worst for us?

17
00:00:42,429 --> 00:00:44,000
