00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,850
Congratulations. You've gone through the entire deep neural networks introduction.

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,675
I am super, super proud of you.

3
00:00:06,675 --> 00:00:09,495
Now, you know what neural networks are,

4
00:00:09,495 --> 00:00:11,640
how to build them, train them,

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,395
and optimize their performance.

6
00:00:13,395 --> 00:00:15,540
You are fully equipped to go through the rest of

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,660
the class learning interesting cutting edge applications,

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,600
such as image recognition and sequence generation.

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,000
I'll see you in the next session.
