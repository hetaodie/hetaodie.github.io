1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,419
Now, you may be wondering what happens if we have more data columns,

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:04,905
so not just testing grades,

3
00:00:04,905 --> 00:00:08,085
but maybe something else like the ranking of the student in the class.

4
00:00:08,085 --> 00:00:11,060
How do we fit three columns of data?

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,608
Well, the only difference is that now we won't be working in two dimensions,

6
00:00:14,608 --> 00:00:16,940
we'll be working in three.

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,260
So now we have three axis, X1 for the test,

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,929
X2 for the grades, and X3 for the class ranking.

9
00:00:21,928 --> 00:00:23,628
And our data will look like this,

10
00:00:23,629 --> 00:00:27,379
like a bunch of blue and red points flying around in 3D.

11
00:00:27,379 --> 00:00:30,359
And our equation won't be aligned in two dimension but a plane in

12
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,920
three dimensions with a similar equation as before.

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,423
Now the equation would be W1X1 + W2X2 + W3X3 + B= 0,

14
00:00:40,423 --> 00:00:43,929
which will separate the space into two regions.

15
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:47,443
This equation can still be abbreviated by WX + B = 0,

16
00:00:47,442 --> 00:00:52,489
except our vectors will now have three entries instead of two.

17
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,975
And our prediction will still be Y high equals one if WX + B is

18
00:00:55,975 --> 00:01:00,895
greater than or equal to zero and zero of WX + B is less than zero.

19
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:02,490
And what if we have many columns,

20
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,605
like say n of them?

21
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:09,400
Well, it's the same thing. Now our data just leaps in n dimensional space.

22
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,120
Now, I have trouble picturing things in more than three dimensions.

23
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,582
But if we can imagine that the points are just things with n coordinates called X1,

24
00:01:16,581 --> 00:01:20,024
X2, X3, all the way up to Xn,

25
00:01:20,024 --> 00:01:22,245
with our labels being y,

26
00:01:22,245 --> 00:01:26,849
then our boundary is just an n-1 dimensional hyper-plane,

27
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:32,030
which is a high dimensional equivalent of a line in 2D or a plane in 3D.

28
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,849
And the equation of this n-1 dimensional hyper-plane is going to be

29
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:42,380
W1X1+ W2X2 + all the way to WnXn + B = 0,

30
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:49,030
which we can still abbreviate to WX + B = 0 where our vectors now have n entries.

31
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,632
And our prediction is still the same as before.

32
00:01:51,632 --> 00:01:55,530
It is y hat equals 1 if WX + B is greater than or equal to

33
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:01,000
zero and Y hat equal zero if WX + B is less than zero.
