00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,924
Now let me show you a trick that will make a line go closer to a point.

2
00:00:03,924 --> 00:00:08,865
Let's say we have our linear equation for example three x one plus four x two minus 10.

3
00:00:08,865 --> 00:00:11,810
And that linear equation gives us a line which is

4
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:15,015
the points where the equation is zero and two regions.

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:19,949
The positive region drawn in blue with three x one plus four x two minus 10 is positive.

6
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:22,589
And the negative region drawn in red with

7
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:26,750
three x one plus four x two minus 10 is negative.

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,108
So, here we have our lonely misclassified point,

9
00:00:29,108 --> 00:00:32,460
the point four coma five which is a red point in the blue area.

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,840
And the points has come closer.

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,310
So how do we get that point to come closer to the line?

12
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,085
Well the idea is we're going to take the four and the five,

13
00:00:41,085 --> 00:00:44,204
and use them to modify the equation of the line

14
00:00:44,204 --> 00:00:48,199
in order to get the line to move closer to the point.

15
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,225
So, here are parameters of the line three four and minus 10.

16
00:00:52,225 --> 00:00:54,770
And the coordinates of the point are four and five.

17
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,780
And let's also add a one here for the bias unit.

18
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,100
So, what we'll do is subtract these numbers from

19
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,530
the parameters of the line to get three minus four,

20
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,109
four minus five and minus 10 minus one.

21
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,329
The new line will have parameters minus one,

22
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:13,090
minus one and minus 11.

23
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,380
And this line will move drastically towards the point.

24
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:19,004
Possibly even going over it and placing it in the correct area.

25
00:01:19,004 --> 00:01:20,780
Now, since we have a lot of other points,

26
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,000
we don't want to make any drastic moves as you may

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,230
accidentally misclassify all our other points.

28
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,064
We want the line to make a small move towards the point,

29
00:01:29,064 --> 00:01:33,149
and for this we need to take small steps towards the point.

30
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,600
So, here's where we introduce the learning rate?

31
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:37,274
The learning rate is a small number,

32
00:01:37,275 --> 00:01:39,440
for example zero point one.

33
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,450
And what we'll do is instead of subtracting

34
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,130
four five and one from the coordinates of the line,

35
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:47,780
we'll multiply these numbers by zero point one,

36
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:51,109
and then subtract them from the equation of the line.

37
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:53,179
This means we'll be subtracting point four,

38
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,550
point five, and point one from the equation of the line.

39
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,119
Obtaining an equation of two point six

40
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,715
x one plus three point five x two minus 10 point one equals zero.

41
00:02:04,715 --> 00:02:07,890
This new line will actually move closer to the point.

42
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,194
In the same way if we have a blue point in the red area,

43
00:02:11,194 --> 00:02:12,919
for example the point one one,

44
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:16,829
it's positively labeled point in the negative area.

45
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,920
This point is also misclassified and it says come closer.

46
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:23,089
So, what do we do here is the same thing except now instead of

47
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:27,110
subtracting the coordinates to the parameters of the line, we add them.

48
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:31,240
Again, we multiply by the learning rate in order to make small steps.

49
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,240
So, here we take the coordinates of the point

50
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,540
one one and put an extra one for the constant term.

51
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:40,484
And now we multiply them by the learning rates zero point one.

52
00:02:40,485 --> 00:02:43,260
Now, we add them to the parameters of the line.

53
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:46,799
And we get a new line with equation three point one

54
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,950
x one plus four point one x two minus nine point nine.

55
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:54,674
And magic. This line is closer to the point.

56
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:59,000
So, that's the trick we're going to use repeatedly for the perceptron algorithm.
