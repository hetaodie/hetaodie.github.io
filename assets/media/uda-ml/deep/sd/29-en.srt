1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,089
Let's look bit closer into Cross-Entropy by switching to a different example.

2
00:00:07,089 --> 00:00:08,644
Let's say we have three doors,

3
00:00:08,644 --> 00:00:11,275
and no this is not the Monty Hall problem.

4
00:00:11,275 --> 00:00:15,060
We have the green door, the red door, and the blue door.

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,699
And behind each door, we could have a gift or not have a gift,

6
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:23,125
and the probabilities of there being a gift behind each door is 0.8 for the first one,

7
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:25,018
0.7 for the second one,

8
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:27,088
and 0.1 for the third one.

9
00:00:27,088 --> 00:00:31,988
So, for example, behind the green door there's an 80 percent probability of there

10
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:37,270
being a gift and a 20 percent probability of there not being a gift.

11
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,759
So, we can put the information in

12
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:41,490
this table where the probabilities of there being a gift are

13
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,350
given in the top row and

14
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,000
the probabilities of there not being a gift are given in the bottom row.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,149
So, let's say we want to make a bet on the outcome.

16
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:53,353
So, we want to try to figure out what is the most likely scenario here.

17
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:56,954
And for that, we'll assume they're independent events.

18
00:00:56,954 --> 00:00:59,880
In this case, the most likely scenario is just

19
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,215
obtained by picking the largest probability in each column.

20
00:01:03,215 --> 00:01:06,879
So, for the first door is more likely to have a gift than not have a gift.

21
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:09,209
So, we'll say there's a gift behind the first door.

22
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:12,629
For the second door, it's also more likely that there's a gift.

23
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:15,120
So, we'll say there's a gift behind the second door.

24
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,040
And for the third door, it's much more likely that there's no gift.

25
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,084
So, we'll say there's no gift behind the third door.

26
00:01:21,084 --> 00:01:22,680
And as the events are independent,

27
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,560
the probability for this whole arrangement is the product of

28
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,349
the three probabilities which is 0.8 x 0.7 x 0.9,

29
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:37,109
which ends up being 0.504 which is roughly 50 percent.

30
00:01:37,108 --> 00:01:39,643
So, let's look on the possible scenarios in the table.

31
00:01:39,644 --> 00:01:43,079
Here's a table with all the possible scenarios for each door

32
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:47,074
and there are eight scenarios since each door gives us two possibilities each.

33
00:01:47,075 --> 00:01:49,189
And there are three doors.

34
00:01:49,188 --> 00:01:51,539
So, we do this before to obtain the probability of

35
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:57,674
each arrangement by multiplying the three independent probabilities to get these numbers.

36
00:01:57,674 --> 00:02:00,180
You can check that these numbers add to one.

37
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,670
And from the last video, we learn that the negative of

38
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,855
the logarithm of the probability is the cross-entropy.

39
00:02:05,855 --> 00:02:09,408
So, let's go ahead and calculate the cross-entropy.

40
00:02:09,408 --> 00:02:11,473
Here we get these numbers.

41
00:02:11,473 --> 00:02:14,429
And notice that the events with high probability have

42
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:20,110
high cross-entropy and the events with low probability have a low cross-entropy.

43
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,879
For example, the second row which has probability of

44
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:28,174
0.504 gives a small cross-entropy of 0.69.

45
00:02:28,175 --> 00:02:32,319
And the second to last row which is very very unlikely has a probability

46
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:38,769
of 0.006 gives a cross-entropy of 5.12.

47
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,280
So, let's actually calculate a formula for the cross-entropy.

48
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,430
Here we have our three doors and our sample scenario said that there's

49
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:50,294
a gift behind the first and second doors and no gift behind the third door.

50
00:02:50,294 --> 00:02:53,110
Recall that the probabilities of these events happening

51
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,905
are 0.8 for a gift behind the first door,

52
00:02:55,905 --> 00:02:58,038
0.7 for a gift behind the second door,

53
00:02:58,038 --> 00:03:01,429
and 0.9 for a no gift behind the third door.

54
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,250
So, when we calculate the cross-entropy,

55
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,430
we get the negative of the logarithm of

56
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:11,754
the product which is the sum of the negatives of the logarithms of the factors,

57
00:03:11,753 --> 00:03:16,724
which is -ln(0.8) - ln(0.7) - ln(0.9).

58
00:03:16,724 --> 00:03:20,943
And in order to derive the formula without some variables.

59
00:03:20,943 --> 00:03:24,763
So, let's call p1 the probability that there's a gift behind the first door,

60
00:03:24,764 --> 00:03:27,840
p2 the probability there's a gift behind the second door,

61
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,685
and p2 the probability there's a gift behind the third door.

62
00:03:31,685 --> 00:03:34,139
So, this 0.8 here is p1,

63
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:36,465
this 0.7 here is p2,

64
00:03:36,465 --> 00:03:39,009
and this 0.9 here is 1-p3,

65
00:03:39,008 --> 00:03:40,758
since the probability of there not being

66
00:03:40,758 --> 00:03:44,168
a gift is one minus the probability of there being a gift.

67
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:48,680
And let's have another variable called y_i which will be one,

68
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,539
if there is a present behind the ith door and zero, there's no present.

69
00:03:53,538 --> 00:03:56,988
So, y_i is technically a number of presents behind the ith door?

70
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:04,164
In this case, y1=1, y2=1, and y3=0.

71
00:04:04,163 --> 00:04:07,359
So, we can put all this together and derive a formula for the cross-entropy.

72
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,120
And it's this sum.

73
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,060
Now, let's look at the formula inside the summation.

74
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:18,139
Noted that if there's a present behind ith door then y_i=1.

75
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:24,350
So, the first term is logarithm of p_i and the second term is zero.

76
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:28,035
Likewise, if there is no present behind the ith door,

77
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:30,300
then y_i is zero.

78
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:36,459
So, this first term is zero and this term is precisely logarithm of one minus p_i.

79
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:40,105
Therefore, this formula really encompasses the sums of the negatives of

80
00:04:40,105 --> 00:04:44,310
the logarithms which is precisely the cross-entropy.

81
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:49,435
So, the cross-entropy really tells us when two vectors are similar or different.

82
00:04:49,435 --> 00:04:53,507
For example, if you calculate the cross-entropy of the pair (1,1,0)

83
00:04:53,507 --> 00:04:58,685
and (0.8,0.7,0.1) we get 0.69.

84
00:04:58,685 --> 00:05:03,550
And that is low because 1,1,0 is a similar vector to 0.8, 0.7,

85
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:09,169
0.1 which means that the arrangement of gifts given by the first set

86
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,660
of numbers is likely to happen

87
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,634
based on the probabilities given by the second set of numbers.

88
00:05:15,634 --> 00:05:21,430
But on the other hand, if we calculate the cross-entropy of the pairs (0,0,1) and (0.8,

89
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:26,959
0.7, 0.1) that is 5.12 which is very high.

90
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:31,129
This is because the arrangement of gifts being given by the first set of numbers is

91
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:36,180
very unlikely to happen from the probabilities given by the second set of numbers.
