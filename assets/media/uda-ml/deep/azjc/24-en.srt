1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
Now we publish this result in the journal Nature.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,320
In fact, it became a cover of Nature.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,919
At the time, it was the fourth most discussed nature paper ever.

4
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:14,445
And it really raised a lot of questions.

5
00:00:14,445 --> 00:00:19,105
What is the future of medicine look like if effectively,

6
00:00:19,105 --> 00:00:23,039
a camera-based system can outperform the best human doctors?

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,530
Now what I want to caution here a little

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,350
bit because this is a study done on images alone.

9
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,840
And a doctor does much more than just looking at images.

10
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:32,215
He knows the patient.

11
00:00:32,215 --> 00:00:35,265
There would be an impression of the patient and so on.

12
00:00:35,265 --> 00:00:39,140
But still, a shocking an image-based said that effectively,

13
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,579
an iPhone does as well as a highly paid doctor.

14
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:44,619
And that discussion is ongoing.

15
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:48,899
The reason why I want you to do this on your own now in an exercise and

16
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,909
experience the same phenomena with this more data set is because,

17
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:55,819
what you're learning here in this class,

18
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,840
in Deep Learning has the potential to massively change how the society works.

19
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:08,085
Many of us, many of us do the same repetitive task every day, in and out.

20
00:01:08,084 --> 00:01:12,564
We might be lawyers doing contract drafting or a legal document discovery.

21
00:01:12,564 --> 00:01:15,584
You might be doctors trying to catch cancer.

22
00:01:15,584 --> 00:01:18,474
You might be truck drivers driving trucks.

23
00:01:18,474 --> 00:01:20,324
Pilots flying planes.

24
00:01:20,325 --> 00:01:23,765
Researchers doing financial investment research on the web.

25
00:01:23,765 --> 00:01:25,935
Brokers, insurance brokers.

26
00:01:25,935 --> 00:01:29,519
All of us do the same thing over and over again.

27
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:31,789
And what AI can do with us,

28
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:32,930
it can make us super human.

29
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:36,915
Given the capability of the best of demontologist and give it to everybody.

30
00:01:36,915 --> 00:01:40,530
The capabilities of the best accountants and give it to everybody.

31
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,335
The capabilities of the best salespeople and give it to everybody.

32
00:01:44,335 --> 00:01:47,310
That's going to be the pure illusion.

33
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,629
And by you taking this course and learning how to apply deeply and interesting problems.

34
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:57,444
You can make people superhuman and you can probably build a business almost everywhere,

35
00:01:57,444 --> 00:02:00,059
where people do highly repetitive office work.

36
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,719
I believe Deep Learning will make people five, ten,

37
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,590
20 times as efficient and as you become more efficient,

38
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,680
our jobs will change.

39
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,965
A long time ago,

40
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:14,250
a U.S. farmer was able to feed about four people.

41
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,514
Today, one farmer can feed 155 people in the world.

42
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:22,314
Today, an account might have 10 clients and 20 clients.

43
00:02:22,314 --> 00:02:25,599
In the future might be 150 clients, a thousand clients.

44
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,799
If you think about this,

45
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,120
the potential of these technology is unbelievable.
