00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,929
Here, you see the natural evolution of a melanoma over the years from 2003 to 2006.

2
00:00:04,929 --> 00:00:09,300
And there's characteristics that doctors use for finding melanomas.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,970
They look at the fuzziness of the border, the asymmetry,

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,080
the coloration, of course,

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,833
the growth rate if it is accessible.

6
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:16,399
But still, classifying melanomas, as I've shown you,

7
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:18,779
is very hard problem.

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,955
Partially, it's hard because some people have lots of moles.

9
00:00:21,954 --> 00:00:25,664
These are clinical images of two backs and you can see how many moles they are,

10
00:00:25,664 --> 00:00:28,554
and finding the one that's malignant is really, really hard.

11
00:00:28,554 --> 00:00:34,109
So, dermatologists are extremely highly trained to find melanomas and carcinomas.

12
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:36,664
And as a result, they make a lot of money.

13
00:00:36,664 --> 00:00:40,859
The average dermatologist in United States makes more than $400,000 a year.

14
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:44,505
There is about 10,000 of them in total and they are incredibly hard to train

15
00:00:44,505 --> 00:00:49,000
because they need to make life and death decisions in diagnosing your skin.
