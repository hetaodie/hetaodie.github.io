1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,629
Here's our curve for Carcinoma.

2
00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:04,849
You find that in certain regimes,

3
00:00:04,849 --> 00:00:06,389
it's 100 percent specific,

4
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:08,240
100 percent sensitive, and it's

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,684
only the little blue area on the top right that I are misclassifications.

6
00:00:12,685 --> 00:00:17,100
And there, we can now set thresholds to emphasize the detection of

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,689
cancer or the reduce the cost of false diagnosis in the lab.

8
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,405
Now, our very first doctor is this point over here,

9
00:00:24,405 --> 00:00:27,441
and it's shocking to see how much fat is below or the blue curve.

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,309
In fact for the same specitivity,

11
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:34,429
he will miss three times as many cancers as our normal program is.

12
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:38,094
That is quite significant, in my opinion.

13
00:00:38,094 --> 00:00:41,609
We then decided to test even more doctors and

14
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:45,644
here's a test set of 25 dermatologists all in the same data.

15
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:47,245
And what you find is,

16
00:00:47,244 --> 00:00:52,349
there is a whole bunch of people that are willing to send people to the lab but still

17
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:58,140
miss significant number of cancers where our evidence is effectively perfect.

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,939
What's also shocking about the result to me,

19
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:01,585
personally, is the spread.

20
00:01:01,585 --> 00:01:04,500
There are some that are aggressively sending

21
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,234
skin samples to the lab and have a good chance of finding your cancers,

22
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:12,614
and others probably laugh by the endurances who don't send few of the samples to the lab,

23
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:15,307
and therefore, reduce diagnostic costs.

24
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:18,575
Who knows? But you can see from this diagram,

25
00:01:18,575 --> 00:01:21,150
whether your personal skin cancer's detected,

26
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,760
depends a lot on which doctor you choose.

27
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,859
And since this kind of data is never made public,

28
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:29,239
we don't even know which doctor are more specific,

29
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:31,439
measure more sensitive to cancer.

30
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,939
They appear the safer melanomas, the more important class,

31
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:37,814
and yet the results are left with a conventional image.

32
00:01:37,814 --> 00:01:41,724
On the right side, results taken with a special instrument called a dormoscope,

33
00:01:41,724 --> 00:01:45,824
and you can see again the enormous spread in all these cases,

34
00:01:45,825 --> 00:01:49,150
the green dot is the mean of all the doctors.

35
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:53,640
So, we went to all doctors and took the mean vote by the doctors.

36
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,775
You would, in all cases,

37
00:01:54,775 --> 00:02:00,000
feel significantly worse than if a neural network looks at your skin.
