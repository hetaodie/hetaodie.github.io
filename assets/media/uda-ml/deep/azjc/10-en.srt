00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,375
Interviewers never go and ask you interesting question, which surprised me.

2
00:00:04,375 --> 00:00:05,995
We trained this network twice,

3
00:00:05,995 --> 00:00:08,160
once from scratch with random weights,

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,533
and once pre-initialized using weights that Google supplied us,

5
00:00:12,532 --> 00:00:14,964
which had previously been arrived at by

6
00:00:14,964 --> 00:00:17,519
training this network to do complete different things,

7
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:21,245
like cats and dogs and horses and cars.

8
00:00:21,245 --> 00:00:24,030
Now, do you think the pre-training with cats and horses and

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:28,195
cars will make cancer classification better,

10
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:31,000
it would be indifferent, or it's going to make it worse?
