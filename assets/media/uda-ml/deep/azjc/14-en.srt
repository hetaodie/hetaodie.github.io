00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,770
Let me use these medical words because it makes sense.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:08,039
A algorithm is deemed to be sensitive to cancer if it finds cancer.

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,694
So to make your algorithm maximally sensitive,

4
00:00:10,695 --> 00:00:12,960
you classify everything as cancer.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,890
And it finds all the cancer, it gets 100 percent sensitivity.

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,850
Now, that's not a good algorithm,

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,385
because now you cut out every single mole you find.

8
00:00:20,385 --> 00:00:22,160
The opposite of this is specificity,

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,615
and so you want 100 percent specificity

10
00:00:24,614 --> 00:00:28,000
because you only want to send things so the lab that are actually cancer.
