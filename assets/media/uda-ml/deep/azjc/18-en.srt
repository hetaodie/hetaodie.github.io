1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,139
So here is the ROC curve for our carcinoma classifier.

2
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:08,084
In medicine, often we show the entire curve.

3
00:00:08,085 --> 00:00:09,660
You know them as ROC curve,

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,689
the sensitivity specificity curve.

5
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:15,379
And I'm going to have a quiz for you on which you should be able to answer.

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,490
Suppose we made a neuron network that completely

7
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:20,264
ignored the image and randomly split out the number between zero and one,

8
00:00:20,265 --> 00:00:22,545
and we draw the same curve for that.

9
00:00:22,545 --> 00:00:27,080
Which of the three shapes would best characterize the output of the network?
