1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,735
So let us talk about deep learning for skin cancer classification.

2
00:00:03,735 --> 00:00:05,430
My students, Brett and Andre,

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,785
and our collaborators in the School of Medicine,

4
00:00:07,785 --> 00:00:10,710
collected roughly 130,000 images

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,773
of skin conditions from various data sources, including the Web.

6
00:00:13,773 --> 00:00:17,620
Those include the images they are going to use for the competition.

7
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,520
And these images came with disease labels.

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,118
All these images were biopsied.

9
00:00:22,118 --> 00:00:27,160
So someone had actually cut out the condition and done a correct diagnostic.

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,589
So we knew for all of these images what the ground truth classification is.

11
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:33,480
Unfortunately, it was not just cancer or non-cancer.

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,370
It came with 2,000 different diseases,

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,830
from inflammatory diseases, to rashes,

14
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,580
to lesions, to all kinds of stuff.

15
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,845
So we built a classification tree, manually,

16
00:00:43,845 --> 00:00:48,998
of different types of diseases of the skin with 2,000 nodes at the end.

17
00:00:48,998 --> 00:00:50,480
Here is a little small version of it.

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,766
Skin disease is shown in blue.

19
00:00:52,766 --> 00:00:54,353
We have different types of diseases;

20
00:00:54,353 --> 00:00:58,455
benign diseases, non-neoplastic diseases, and malignant diseases.

21
00:00:58,455 --> 00:01:00,885
And even among the malignant diseases, there are many,

22
00:01:00,885 --> 00:01:03,710
many different classes of carcinomas and melanomas.

23
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,547
And melanomas are this little black dot over here,

24
00:01:05,547 --> 00:01:08,000
and that's the one we're really after because it is the more lethal of all cancers .
