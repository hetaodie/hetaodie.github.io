1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,710
To validate our results,

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:05,025
we constructed an independent test set,

3
00:00:05,025 --> 00:00:06,885
and we've worked really hard to clean up the data.

4
00:00:06,884 --> 00:00:09,660
The data was, in many cases, had duplicates,

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,285
we didn't want just split trading and test and there's

6
00:00:12,285 --> 00:00:15,227
a chance that the same image occurs in training and testing.

7
00:00:15,227 --> 00:00:16,859
It had some data markers,

8
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:20,405
some dermatologist had put markers on specific classes.

9
00:00:20,405 --> 00:00:23,325
Like they picked yellow markers for size determination.

10
00:00:23,324 --> 00:00:25,457
And of course, we didn't want to take an interval to find yellow markers,

11
00:00:25,457 --> 00:00:28,464
we wanted to find cancers so a way to remove those images and clean them up.

12
00:00:28,464 --> 00:00:33,210
But after the clean up, we were able to take a subset of the images to be testing set,

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,736
and as you always do to validate your results.

14
00:00:36,735 --> 00:00:39,299
And interestingly enough, the very first

15
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:42,195
time we did a three way classification between melanoma's, carcinomas,

16
00:00:42,195 --> 00:00:43,859
and P nine we,

17
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:48,409
got a 72 percent accuracy in finding cancers.

18
00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:51,886
And, we felt that was significant.

19
00:00:51,887 --> 00:00:53,561
So we decided to go to

20
00:00:53,561 --> 00:00:56,245
the School of Medicine and open the door of the real dermatologist.

21
00:00:56,246 --> 00:00:59,625
And the person whose name I named here,

22
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:02,280
was willing enough to look at the same images as we used for

23
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,885
testing and was 65 percent correct.

24
00:01:06,885 --> 00:01:10,109
A whooping 6.4 percent less than us.

25
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:12,599
That is significant in cancer detection.

26
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:15,509
So we knocked on the door of a second dermatologist and asked the same question.

27
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,810
He was willing enough to do it,

28
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:20,649
and we got to 66 percent correct classification rate.

29
00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:22,560
So we had all of a sudden,

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,040
in knowing that rock that,

31
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,195
if looking at images seemed more accurate than

32
00:01:27,194 --> 00:01:31,184
two board certified Stanford level of interest in finding skin cancer,

33
00:01:31,185 --> 00:01:33,390
that got our attention.

34
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,000
So now we decided to do a real experiment.
