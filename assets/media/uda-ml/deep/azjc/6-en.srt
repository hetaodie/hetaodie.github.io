1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,339
Just to show how difficult it is to find skin cancer,

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:04,224
I challenge you to look at this image,

3
00:00:04,224 --> 00:00:07,574
and if you have a doctor in your family or your friends,

4
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:11,250
show them the image and ask them what they think is cancer.

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,335
You can see different types of lesions,

6
00:00:13,335 --> 00:00:15,450
and you can see benign and malignant lesions,

7
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:17,939
and these are all correctly classified.

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,105
And I challenge you to find the pattern that tells

9
00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:27,283
the 12 images on the top part from the 12 images at the bottom. It's not an easy thing.

10
00:00:27,283 --> 00:00:31,649
That's how you thought a neural network is a good candidate because neural networks can

11
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:33,984
process hundreds of thousands of images as

12
00:00:33,984 --> 00:00:38,000
a human doctor can never study as many as you can feed into a neural network.
