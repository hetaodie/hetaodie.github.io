00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,830
As you have Googled, this is probably shocking to

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:05,050
see how much difference is between stage zero and stage IV.

3
00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:07,290
I think the curves I'm showing you here at this moment

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,628
show the difference in survival outlook for the different stages.

5
00:00:10,628 --> 00:00:14,274
What's even more shocking is how similar stage zero and stage IV is.

6
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:16,844
Look at those images here on the right side.

7
00:00:16,844 --> 00:00:21,179
A stage zero cancer has barely penetrated the surface, but it is very visible.

8
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:24,265
But a stage IV cancer has just

9
00:00:24,265 --> 00:00:28,469
grown below the skin layer and touched the underlying tissue and vessels.

10
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:29,599
It hasn't even spread yet,

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,545
and yet, with this kind of cancer,

12
00:00:31,545 --> 00:00:33,885
which can develop in less than a year,

13
00:00:33,884 --> 00:00:37,949
your survival chances would be south of 20 percent.

14
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,270
Therefore, early detection is paramount to not dying from skin cancer.
