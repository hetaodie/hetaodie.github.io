1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,645
So you've learned about Recall and Precision.

2
00:00:03,645 --> 00:00:07,500
In medicine, we often use the word sensitivity specificity.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,439
And before I dive into the differences,

4
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:11,878
I do have a little quiz you have to Google for that.

5
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:13,890
What is the relationship between sensitivity specificity,

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,000
and recall and precision?
