1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,409
If you've chosen 0.5,

2
00:00:01,409 --> 00:00:06,315
then your chances of accidentally

3
00:00:06,315 --> 00:00:08,699
missing a cancer are exactly the same as

4
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:12,134
your chances of calling something a cancer that isn't.

5
00:00:12,134 --> 00:00:14,129
If you call it 0.8,

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,385
you will be great in reducing the cost of diagnostics,

7
00:00:17,385 --> 00:00:21,320
but bad in helping people survive when they actually have skin cancer.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,315
0.2 is the number I would choose from these numbers,

9
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:28,755
because of the asymmetry of costs of the regret.

10
00:00:28,754 --> 00:00:37,125
So if you find that a person has been sent to the lab but the tissue was not cancerous,

11
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,420
you have a regret, discomfort in

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,405
getting skin extracted and there's a cost to the lab tests,

13
00:00:42,405 --> 00:00:43,780
but the regret is small.

14
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,695
If conversely you overlook a cancer

15
00:00:46,695 --> 00:00:50,155
because you've been just too cheap to send the person to the lab,

16
00:00:50,155 --> 00:00:52,085
then this person might die.

17
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:54,564
And that's a much, much bigger cost.

18
00:00:54,564 --> 00:00:58,550
As a result, 0.5 threshold is not the best threshold,

19
00:00:58,551 --> 00:01:01,530
and we really have to set the threshold in a more aggre-
