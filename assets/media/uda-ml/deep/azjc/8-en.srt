00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,720
If you have the same intuition like me,

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:04,509
you check the first three points, but not the fourth one.

3
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:06,134
But it turns out, in our data,

4
00:00:06,134 --> 00:00:08,730
some dermatologists had taken specific instances of

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,480
skin diseases and edit yellow markers into

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,050
the images for sizing and the neural network could have perfectly

7
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,679
classified that specific disease by becoming a yellow marker detector.

8
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:22,814
So, finding in our data set of 130,000 images,

9
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:26,220
those images with yellow markers, even having the idea that might exist in there,

10
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:28,000
that took months for us to do.
