1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,194
And the answer is, if a network spits out a random number,

2
00:00:03,194 --> 00:00:04,750
then the output, the RC curve,

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,665
is going to be a straight line.

4
00:00:07,665 --> 00:00:10,484
You can dial up your threshold.

5
00:00:10,484 --> 00:00:11,699
And the more dial up,

6
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:12,929
the more cancers you'll find,

7
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:14,570
but there are also more non-cancerous you'll find.

8
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,280
And the ratio of cancerous-non-cancerous would be linear.

9
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,810
Therefore, a completely random algorithm will just show you a straight line.

10
00:00:20,809 --> 00:00:22,829
In fact, anything below the straight line,

11
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:26,250
you should run in a sample test because it just actively kill people,

12
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,480
okay? And we don't know that.
