00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,779
Before we dive into the best strategy for diagnosing, let me just do a quiz.

2
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:08,129
Have you ever know a network that outputs the probability of a melanoma?

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,714
And we have now set a special value.

4
00:00:11,714 --> 00:00:16,425
When we decide to classify it as melanoma or as no melanoma.

5
00:00:16,425 --> 00:00:20,000
And their value is between zero and one what value would you choose?
