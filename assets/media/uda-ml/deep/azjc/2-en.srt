1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,264
So, let's dive in. To set the stage on,

2
00:00:04,264 --> 00:00:08,250
skin cancer is the most common cancer in the world.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,974
It's not the most deadly but the most common.

4
00:00:09,974 --> 00:00:15,460
In the U.S., we find 5.4 million new cases of skin cancer every year.

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,370
They come in different types.

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,510
Some are called Carcinomas,

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,995
some are called Melanomas.

8
00:00:19,995 --> 00:00:23,880
Melanomas are the ones that typically kill people, it's called the black cancer.

9
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:26,879
Twenty percent of Americans will eventually get skin cancer.

10
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:28,759
In most cases, benign cancer.

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,070
Pre-cancer also cause a Actinic Keratosis,

12
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,030
affects 58 million Americans and many more in the world.

13
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,859
We have, in this country,

14
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:43,729
76,000 Melanomas each year and 10,000 deaths.

15
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:45,034
To put this in perspective,

16
00:00:45,034 --> 00:00:48,394
traffic accidents in this country are 40,000, so,

17
00:00:48,395 --> 00:00:53,870
you are about four times as likely to die in a traffic collision than a skin cancer.

18
00:00:53,869 --> 00:00:59,114
The cost for United States per year is 8.1 billion in treatment and diagnostics.

19
00:00:59,115 --> 00:01:01,334
Before I move on, I want to do a quiz with you,

20
00:01:01,334 --> 00:01:04,040
and that requires some Googling.

21
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,350
Skin cancer comes in multiple stages from stage zero to stage four.

22
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:12,614
What do you think the five-year survival probability is for stage four skin cancer?

23
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,039
What do you think is for stage zero?
