00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,870
Machine Learning has beautiful techniques to visualize results.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,150
And one of the experiments we did is to take

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,050
these incredibly high dimensional outputs and cluster them into two-dimensional space.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,015
These are technologies that you could learn now on machinery

5
00:00:13,015 --> 00:00:16,335
that we won't go into detail but the image is fun to see.

6
00:00:16,335 --> 00:00:20,450
The East dot in this two-dimensional sphere is now one image patch.

7
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:25,980
You can then appear to dot and rearranging these dots by proximity,

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,399
by similarity in our feature space as embodied by the neural network.

9
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:33,464
And what you find is that,

10
00:00:33,465 --> 00:00:37,250
different types of images cluster very nicely in

11
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,134
the space of features extracted by the neural networks the melanomas evaded

12
00:00:41,134 --> 00:00:45,539
sensing class that says in a certain primitive space that is very different from

13
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:50,185
various other types of carcinomas and skin conditions in this visualization over him.

14
00:00:50,185 --> 00:00:52,635
There's an interesting finding that no liquid really comes because

15
00:00:52,634 --> 00:00:56,015
the substance of what it means to classify it as skin cancer.

16
00:00:56,015 --> 00:01:00,924
In my opinion, much more profound way than possibly before this experiment.

17
00:01:00,924 --> 00:01:03,989
If you look back on the images that are represented by

18
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:08,219
these dots you can look at the original raw images and you find to the human eye.

19
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:12,459
There's also similarities or similar images are being grouped and similar places as.
