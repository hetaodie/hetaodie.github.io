Hi. My name is Sebastian.

2
00:00:01,945 --> 00:00:05,835
You might know me as the godfather of self driving cars,

3
00:00:05,835 --> 00:00:11,240
as Udacity co-founder, or just as a random guy who lives in Palo Alto.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,551
But I also teach at Stanford and my Stanford students and I,

5
00:00:15,551 --> 00:00:21,195
this year, looked into skin cancer as an application for deep learning.

6
00:00:21,195 --> 00:00:25,060
In this lesson, I would tell you some of the results we've accomplished.

7
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:29,144
May ask you a few questions but most importantly, at the end of his lesson,

8
00:00:29,144 --> 00:00:32,549
you'll give a chance to train your own deep network to

9
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,149
detect skin cancer using an international data set that we provide.
