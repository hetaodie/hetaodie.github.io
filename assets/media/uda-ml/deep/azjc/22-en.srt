1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,150
Finally, we ask the question, what is network fixating on?

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:03,375
What is that you look at?

3
00:00:03,375 --> 00:00:05,618
And you can do a sensitivity analysis.

4
00:00:05,618 --> 00:00:07,679
You can wiggle your input image

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:10,019
a little bit and see how much the output class of wiggles.

6
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:11,070
And for some wiggles,

7
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,490
if you wiggle them a little bit the output does not change very much.

8
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,160
But for others it changes a lot.

9
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,160
That is called a sensitivity analysis and that gives you

10
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,160
a feeling for why does no one ever pay attention.

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,341
What factors are the images normally used to arrive at its conclusion.

12
00:00:24,341 --> 00:00:28,545
Here is a melanoma and you can see on the right side in this diagram,

13
00:00:28,545 --> 00:00:31,704
the darker dot the more important that feature is.

14
00:00:31,704 --> 00:00:33,494
If you look in detail here,

15
00:00:33,494 --> 00:00:36,359
you will see that this melanoma has already

16
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:39,674
spread a little bit and is comprised of multiple black dots.

17
00:00:39,674 --> 00:00:41,820
And the fact that there are multiple black dots

18
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,179
seems to have a big impact on the vote of the

19
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:49,854
[inaudible] as shown by the corresponding dark areas in the right image.

20
00:00:49,854 --> 00:00:53,684
Take some time and study this image over here and look at the different types

21
00:00:53,685 --> 00:00:57,794
of skin patches and what region of those patches play a big role.

22
00:00:57,793 --> 00:01:00,674
All these images were classified correctly,

23
00:01:00,674 --> 00:01:04,034
and in some cases you will see that the entire image matters; in others,

24
00:01:04,034 --> 00:01:07,349
very specific features of being emphasis with an [inaudible] classification.

25
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:09,809
The network is smart enough to really understand

26
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,230
what part of the image is essential for finding cancer.
