00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
>>Now, we'll learn another technique to evaluate a model called

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.144
the Receiver Operator Characteristic curve or ROC curve for short,

3
00:00:07.144 --> 00:00:09.119
and it works as follows.

4
00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:11.399
Consider this data which is now one dimensional,

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.050
so all the red and blue points lie in one line,

6
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.455
and we want to find the correct split.

7
00:00:16.454 --> 00:00:19.034
So, we can have a split like around here,

8
00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:21.405
or maybe here, or here.

9
00:00:21.405 --> 00:00:22.730
All of them are good splits.

10
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.039
So, we'll call this a good split.

11
00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.539
Now, we can look at this data which as you can see is perfectly separable over here.

12
00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.640
So, we'll call that a perfect split.

13
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.310
And finally, we have this data over here which is pretty much random,

14
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.594
and there's not much to split here.

15
00:00:37.594 --> 00:00:39.240
It seems that anywhere we put the boundary,

16
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.500
we'll have about half blue,

17
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.409
half red points on each side.

18
00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:45.579
So, we'll call that a bad split or a random split.

19
00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.399
And now what we want is to come up with a metric or

20
00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.964
some number that is high for the perfect split,

21
00:00:49.965 --> 00:00:51.570
medium for the good split,

22
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.335
and low for the random split.

23
00:00:53.335 --> 00:00:56.365
In fact, something that gives the perfect split a score of one,

24
00:00:56.365 --> 00:00:58.965
the good split something around 0.8,

25
00:00:58.965 --> 00:01:02.060
and the random split something around 0.5.

26
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.879
That's where the ROC curve will help us.

27
00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.405
So, let's see how to construct these numbers.

28
00:01:06.405 --> 00:01:10.165
Let's take our good data and let's cut it over here.

29
00:01:10.165 --> 00:01:12.300
Now, we'll calculate two ratios.

30
00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.399
The first one is a true positive rate, which means,

31
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.160
out of all the positively labeled points,

32
00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.979
how many did we classify correctly?

33
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.960
That means, the number of true positives,

34
00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:25.849
divided by the total number of positively labeled points.

35
00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:27.780
So, let's see how much this is.

36
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.224
There are seven positively labeled numbers,

37
00:01:30.224 --> 00:01:33.329
and six of them have been correctly labeled positive.

38
00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.569
So, this ratio is six out of seven, or 0.857.

39
00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:44.836
Now, let's look at the false positive rate which means out of all the negative points,

40
00:01:44.837 --> 00:01:49.250
how many of them did the model incorrectly think they were positives?

41
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.984
So out of the seven negatively labeled points,

42
00:01:52.984 --> 00:01:55.950
the model thought two of them were positive.

43
00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.320
So the false positive rate is two out of seven, or 0.286.

44
00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:04.689
And we'll just remember these two numbers.

45
00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.000
Now, what we'll do,

46
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.995
is we'll move this boundary around and calculate the same pair of numbers.

47
00:02:10.995 --> 00:02:12.990
So, let's play it over here.

48
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.305
What is the true positive rate over here?

49
00:02:15.305 --> 00:02:17.830
Well, the model thinks everything is positive.

50
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.580
So in particular, all the positives are true positives.

51
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.005
So, the true positive rate is seven divided by seven, which is one.

52
00:02:25.004 --> 00:02:27.000
And for the false positive rate.

53
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.534
Well, since the model thinks everything is positive,

54
00:02:29.534 --> 00:02:32.014
then all the negatives are false positive.

55
00:02:32.014 --> 00:02:37.949
So, the false positive rate is again seven divided by seven, which is one.

56
00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:41.969
So again, we'll remember these two values one and one.

57
00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:43.375
And now let's go to the other extreme.

58
00:02:43.375 --> 00:02:47.860
Let's put the bar over here and now let's see what is the true positive rate.

59
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.560
Well, the model thinks nothing is positive.

60
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.284
So in particular, there are no true positives and the ratio is zero divided by seven,

61
00:02:54.284 --> 00:02:56.900
which is zero. And for the false positive rate?

62
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.985
Well, again, the model thinks nothing is positive,

63
00:02:59.985 --> 00:03:01.455
so there are no false positives.

64
00:03:01.455 --> 00:03:05.175
And the ratio is zero over seven, which again is zero.

65
00:03:05.175 --> 00:03:07.219
And we'll remember these two numbers.

66
00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:09.939
We can see that no matter how the data looks,

67
00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.284
the two extremes will always be one,

68
00:03:13.284 --> 00:03:15.449
one and zero, zero.

69
00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:20.069
And now, we can do this for every possible split and record those numbers.

70
00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.340
So here we have a few of them that we've calculated.

71
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.050
And now, the magic happens.

72
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.735
We just pluck these numbers in the plane, and we get a curve.

73
00:03:27.735 --> 00:03:32.275
And now, we calculate the area under the curve and here we get around 0.8.

74
00:03:32.275 --> 00:03:34.965
This is actually not accurate, but it's around there.

75
00:03:34.965 --> 00:03:37.740
You can calculate it on your own and see how much you get.

76
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.064
So now, let's do the same thing for the perfect split.

77
00:03:40.064 --> 00:03:41.919
Here are all the ratios.

78
00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:43.994
Notice that the boundary is on the red side,

79
00:03:43.995 --> 00:03:45.855
and the true positive ratio is

80
00:03:45.854 --> 00:03:49.334
one since every positive number has been predicted positive.

81
00:03:49.335 --> 00:03:52.439
Similarly, if the boundaries on the blue side then every negative number

82
00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:56.324
has been predicted negative and so the false positive ratio is zero.

83
00:03:56.324 --> 00:03:58.739
In particular, at the perfect split point,

84
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.504
we have a zero comma one.

85
00:04:00.504 --> 00:04:02.039
Thus, when we pluck these numbers,

86
00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:04.229
the curve looks like a square,

87
00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:07.530
and the square has area one, which means,

88
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.319
the area under the ROC curve for the perfect split is one.

89
00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.275
And finally, we do this for the random split.

90
00:04:14.275 --> 00:04:15.685
In here, you can try it on your own.

91
00:04:15.685 --> 00:04:20.030
But basically, since every split leaves on each side around half blue, half red points,

92
00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:22.544
many pair of numbers will be close to each other,

93
00:04:22.545 --> 00:04:24.750
and the curve will be very close to being

94
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.904
just a diagonal between zero, zero and one, one.

95
00:04:27.904 --> 00:04:29.579
So if the model is random,

96
00:04:29.579 --> 00:04:33.779
then the area under the ROC curve is around 0.5.

97
00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:36.299
So to summarize, we have three possible scenarios:

98
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.520
some random data which is hard to split,

99
00:04:38.519 --> 00:04:42.224
some pretty good data which we can split well making some errors,

100
00:04:42.225 --> 00:04:46.254
and some perfectly divided data which we can split with no errors.

101
00:04:46.254 --> 00:04:48.014
And each one is associated with a curve,

102
00:04:48.014 --> 00:04:52.544
and the areas under the curve are close to 0.5 for the random model.

103
00:04:52.545 --> 00:04:55.131
Some are close to one for the good model,

104
00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.699
so around 0.8 and one for the perfect model.

105
00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:03.615
So in summary, the closer your area under the ROC curve is to one,

106
00:05:03.615 --> 00:05:05.920
the better your model is.

107
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.786
Now here is a question,

108
00:05:07.786 --> 00:05:12.204
can the area under the curve be less than 0.5?

109
00:05:12.204 --> 00:05:15.384
In fact, yes, it can be all the way to zero.

110
00:05:15.384 --> 00:05:18.615
How would a model look if the area under the curve is zero?

111
00:05:18.615 --> 00:05:20.314
Well, it will look more backwards.

112
00:05:20.314 --> 00:05:22.199
It'll have more blue points in the red area,

113
00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:23.694
and the red points in the blue area.

114
00:05:23.694 --> 00:05:25.250
So maybe flipping the data may help.
