1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
Now, let's look at the second metric which is Recall.

2
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
现在看看第二个指标 即召回率

3
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.174
召回率可以回答以下问题

4
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.174
Recall is the answer to the following question.

5
00:00:05.174 --> 00:00:07.740
在所有标记为阳性的点中

6
00:00:05.174 --> 00:00:07.740
Out of the points that are labeled positive,

7
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.620
how many of them were correctly predicted as positive?

8
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.620
有哪些正确地预测为阳性？

9
00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:13.974
在医疗模型中 召回率可以回答以下问题

10
00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:13.974
So in the medical model, recall is the answer to the following question.

11
00:00:13.974 --> 00:00:15.299
Out of the sick patients,

12
00:00:13.974 --> 00:00:15.299
在生病患者当中

13
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.115
有多少位正确地诊断为生病了？

14
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.115
how many did we correctly diagnosed as sick?

15
00:00:18.114 --> 00:00:21.329
So remember, precision was out of the patients who were diagnosed as sick,

16
00:00:18.114 --> 00:00:21.329
精度是诊断为生病的患者当中

17
00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:22.404
有多少位真正生病了？

18
00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:22.404
how many were actually sick?

19
00:00:22.405 --> 00:00:23.795
但召回率刚好相反

20
00:00:22.405 --> 00:00:23.795
But recall is the opposite.

21
00:00:23.795 --> 00:00:25.620
在生病的患者当中

22
00:00:23.795 --> 00:00:25.620
Out of the patients are sick,

23
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.380
有多少位正确地诊断为生病了？

24
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.380
how many did we correctly diagnosed as sick?

25
00:00:28.379 --> 00:00:30.364
可以看做算法的覆盖范围

26
00:00:28.379 --> 00:00:30.364
It can be seen as a reach of the algorithm.

27
00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:33.600
How many of the positive points did I manage to catch?

28
00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:33.600
我能够发现多少阳性点

29
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.969
答案用这行计算

30
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.969
The answer is calculated with this row.

31
00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.204
可以看出 这行发现了用 X 表示的重要情形

32
00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.204
And as we can see, this row catches a critical case labelled

33
00:00:39.204 --> 00:00:43.269
可以看出在医疗模型中召回率很重要

34
00:00:39.204 --> 00:00:43.269
by an X so we can see that recall is important in the medical model.

35
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.210
要计算召回率 我们执行以下操作

36
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.210
Now to calculate recall, we do the following.

37
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.310
在 1200 位生病患者当中

38
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.310
From a 1200 sick patients,

39
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.500
我们正确地诊断了多少位？

40
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.500
how many did we diagnose correctly?

41
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.715
也就是 1000/1200 等于 83.3%

42
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.715
That's a thousand divided by 1200 which is 83.3%.

43
00:00:54.715 --> 00:00:56.910
This model better have a high recall because we're trying to

44
00:00:54.715 --> 00:00:56.910
这个模型最好具有很高的召回率 因为我们尝试

45
00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:00.239
尽可能发现很多的生病患者

46
00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:00.239
correctly catch as many of the sick people as possible.

47
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.300
Now in the e-mail model,

48
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.300
在电子邮件模型中

49
00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:02.489
recall is defined similarly.

50
00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:02.489
召回率的定义比较相似

51
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.155
计算方式如下

52
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.155
It is calculated as follows.

53
00:01:04.155 --> 00:01:05.724
From the spam emails,

54
00:01:04.155 --> 00:01:05.724
在垃圾邮件中

55
00:01:05.724 --> 00:01:09.834
how many of them did we correctly send to the spam folder?

56
00:01:05.724 --> 00:01:09.834
有多少封正确地发送到了垃圾文件夹？

57
00:01:09.834 --> 00:01:11.219
The answer is in this row over here,

58
00:01:09.834 --> 00:01:11.219
答案是这行

59
00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:17.209
so we have a hundred correctly sent to the spam folder divided by 270 total spam emails.

60
00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:17.209
也就是 100 封正确地发送到垃圾文件夹的邮件除以共 270 封垃圾邮件

61
00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:19.890
数字更小 为 37%

62
00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:19.890
It's a low number. It's 37%.

63
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.969
但是我们关心的是避免这个 X

64
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.969
But remember, we are worried about avoiding this X over here.

65
00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:25.650
Since we don't mind if we don't catch

66
00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:25.650
因为我们并不介意没有发现所有的垃圾邮件

67
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.885
all the spam emails as long as the ones we caught are spam.

68
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.885
只要发现的垃圾邮件的确是垃圾邮件即可

69
00:01:28.885 --> 00:01:31.575
So it's okay that this model has a low recall.

70
00:01:28.885 --> 00:01:31.575
因此这个模型可以具有很低的召回率

71
00:01:31.575 --> 00:01:33.700
Now let's do a similar exercise as before.

72
00:01:31.575 --> 00:01:33.700
我们再做道类似的练习

73
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.710
In this linear model over here,

74
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.710
在此线性模型中

75
00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:37.449
what is the recall?

76
00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:37.449
召回率是多少？

77
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.000
Enter your answer below.

78
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.000
