1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,365
Now, accuracy may not always be the best metric to use.

2
00:00:03,365 --> 00:00:05,054
Let's look at this example.

3
00:00:05,054 --> 00:00:07,615
It consists of detecting credit card fraud.

4
00:00:07,615 --> 00:00:10,740
So we have a bunch of data in the form of credit card transactions,

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,794
and some of them are good like the ones on the left,

6
00:00:12,794 --> 00:00:15,870
and some of them are fraudulent like the ones in the right.

7
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:17,160
So let's look at the numbers.

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,300
There are 284,335 good transactions,

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,570
and 472 fraudulent transactions.

10
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,835
This is actually real data.

11
00:00:25,835 --> 00:00:28,260
So let's try to come up with a model that has great accuracy.

12
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,165
So a model that is correct most of the time.

13
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:36,479
Can you help me think of a model that has over 99% accuracy?

14
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:39,359
So here's a model that has over 99% accuracy,

15
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,494
which means it is correct over 99% of the time.

16
00:00:42,494 --> 00:00:46,679
The model says, all the transactions are good.

17
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,750
Now, what is the accuracy of this model namely,

18
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,195
how many times are we correct?

19
00:00:51,195 --> 00:01:00,359
Well, we're correct 284,335 times out of 384,887 times.

20
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,945
And that is 99.83%.

21
00:01:03,945 --> 00:01:06,769
So this model must be pretty good if it's accurate that high, right?

22
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:10,659
Well, not really. This model is not catching any of the bad ones.

23
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:14,484
And the point of the model is to catch the fraudulent transactions.

24
00:01:14,484 --> 00:01:18,269
So let's look at another model. To get a model that catches all the bad transactions.

25
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:19,894
Can we think of one?

26
00:01:19,894 --> 00:01:23,075
Well here's one, I'm going to label all transactions fraudulent.

27
00:01:23,075 --> 00:01:25,350
So that's great, right? Now we're catching

28
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:28,519
all the fraudulent transactions. Now, is that a good model?

29
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:30,959
Well, no that's also a terrible model since it's accidentally

30
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:33,750
catching all the good ones. So it's pretty tricky, right?

31
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,424
It's pretty tricky to just look at accuracy and use that to evaluate our model,

32
00:01:37,424 --> 00:01:41,459
because it may completely miss the point when the data is skewed like this one.

33
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:46,000
So in this section, we'll study some different metrics that can catch this more easily.
