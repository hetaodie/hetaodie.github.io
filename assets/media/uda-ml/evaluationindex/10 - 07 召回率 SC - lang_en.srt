1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,790
Now, let's look at the second metric which is Recall.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,174
Recall is the answer to the following question.

3
00:00:05,174 --> 00:00:07,740
Out of the points that are labeled positive,

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,620
how many of them were correctly predicted as positive?

5
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:13,974
So in the medical model, recall is the answer to the following question.

6
00:00:13,974 --> 00:00:15,299
Out of the sick patients,

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,115
how many did we correctly diagnosed as sick?

8
00:00:18,114 --> 00:00:21,329
So remember, precision was out of the patients who were diagnosed as sick,

9
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:22,404
how many were actually sick?

10
00:00:22,405 --> 00:00:23,795
But recall is the opposite.

11
00:00:23,795 --> 00:00:25,620
Out of the patients are sick,

12
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,380
how many did we correctly diagnosed as sick?

13
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:30,364
It can be seen as a reach of the algorithm.

14
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:33,600
How many of the positive points did I manage to catch?

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,969
The answer is calculated with this row.

16
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,204
And as we can see, this row catches a critical case labelled

17
00:00:39,204 --> 00:00:43,269
by an X so we can see that recall is important in the medical model.

18
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,210
Now to calculate recall, we do the following.

19
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,310
From a 1200 sick patients,

20
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,500
how many did we diagnose correctly?

21
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,715
That's a thousand divided by 1200 which is 83.3%.

22
00:00:54,715 --> 00:00:56,910
This model better have a high recall because we're trying to

23
00:00:56,909 --> 00:01:00,239
correctly catch as many of the sick people as possible.

24
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,300
Now in the e-mail model,

25
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:02,489
recall is defined similarly.

26
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,155
It is calculated as follows.

27
00:01:04,155 --> 00:01:05,724
From the spam emails,

28
00:01:05,724 --> 00:01:09,834
how many of them did we correctly send to the spam folder?

29
00:01:09,834 --> 00:01:11,219
The answer is in this row over here,

30
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:17,209
so we have a hundred correctly sent to the spam folder divided by 270 total spam emails.

31
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:19,890
It's a low number. It's 37%.

32
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,969
But remember, we are worried about avoiding this X over here.

33
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:25,650
Since we don't mind if we don't catch

34
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,885
all the spam emails as long as the ones we caught are spam.

35
00:01:28,885 --> 00:01:31,575
So it's okay that this model has a low recall.

36
00:01:31,575 --> 00:01:33,700
Now let's do a similar exercise as before.

37
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,710
In this linear model over here,

38
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:37,449
what is the recall?

39
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,000
Enter your answer below.
