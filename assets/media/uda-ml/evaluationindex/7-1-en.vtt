00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.929
So let's go back to our two examples,

2
00:00:01.929 --> 00:00:03.599
the Medical Model and Spam E-mail Model.

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.919
Recalled for the medical model we have four possibilities.

4
00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.320
A true positive, which is when

5
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.765
the patient is sick and we correctly diagnosed him as sick.

6
00:00:13.765 --> 00:00:16.350
A true negative, which is when the patient is

7
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.075
not sick and we correctly diagnosed him as not sick.

8
00:00:20.074 --> 00:00:21.869
A false positive, which is when a patient is

9
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.005
healthy and we incorrectly diagnosed him as sick.

10
00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:26.489
And finally, a false negative,

11
00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:30.625
which is when the patient is sick and we incorrectly diagnosed him as healthy.

12
00:00:30.625 --> 00:00:34.289
Now let's forget about the two correct ones and focus only on the mistakes.

13
00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:36.255
Below we'll have a quiz.

14
00:00:36.255 --> 00:00:37.920
Which one do you think is worse,

15
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.010
a false positive or a false negative?

16
00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:44.339
In other words, what is a worse mistake to misdiagnose

17
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.055
a healthy patient as sick or a sick patient as healthy?

18
00:00:48.054 --> 00:00:49.524
Now let's go back to our other model,

19
00:00:49.524 --> 00:00:50.804
the Spam E-mail Model.

20
00:00:50.804 --> 00:00:51.990
So we have two emails,

21
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.240
one non-spam from a grandmother telling us she baked

22
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.300
cookies and one spam from a questionable source.

23
00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:58.909
Recall that for this model,

24
00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:00.819
we again have four possibilities.

25
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.325
A true positive, which is when the spam e-mail gets correctly sent into the spam folder.

26
00:01:05.325 --> 00:01:06.816
A true negative, which is when

27
00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:09.870
our grandmother's e-mail gets correctly send to the Inbox folder.

28
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.969
A false positive, which is when the grandmother's e-mail

29
00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:14.465
accidentally gets sent to the spam folder.

30
00:01:14.465 --> 00:01:15.659
And finally, a false negative,

31
00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.140
which is when a spam e-mail accidentally gets sent to our inbox.

32
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.094
Now again, let's forget about the two correct ones and focus only on the mistakes.

33
00:01:23.094 --> 00:01:24.980
So below there will be another quiz.

34
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.475
Which one do you think is worse,

35
00:01:26.474 --> 00:01:29.369
a false positive or a false negative?

36
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.380
In other words, what is a worst mistake?

37
00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:33.420
To accidentally send your grandmother's e-mail to

38
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.085
the spam folder or to accidentally send the spam e-mail into your inbox?

39
00:01:38.084 --> 00:01:40.809
Enter your answers below.
