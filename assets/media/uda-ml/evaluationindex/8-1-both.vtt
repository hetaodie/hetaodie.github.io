1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740
So, for the medical model, it seems that we'd much rather

2
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740
对于医疗模型 似乎我们宁愿

3
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.339
将健康人士误诊为生病人士 并继续加以检查

4
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.339
misdiagnose a healthy person as sick and send them for more tests,

5
00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:10.814
也不希望将生病人士误诊为健康人士 并让他们直接回家而不接受治疗

6
00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:10.814
than misdiagnose a sick person who's healthy and send them home without treatment.

7
00:00:10.814 --> 00:00:14.174
In this case, a false negative is much worse than a false positive.

8
00:00:10.814 --> 00:00:14.174
在这种情况下假阴性比假阳性更糟糕

9
00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:15.630
这个模型的规则是

10
00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:15.630
So the rule of this model is,

11
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.725
I want to find all the sick people.

12
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.725
我想要找出所有生病的人士

13
00:00:17.725 --> 00:00:20.465
不小心找到了更多的生病人士也没关系

14
00:00:17.725 --> 00:00:20.465
I'm okay if I accidentally bring some more as sick,

15
00:00:20.464 --> 00:00:22.964
but I need to find all the sick people.

16
00:00:20.464 --> 00:00:22.964
我需要找到所有生病的人

17
00:00:22.964 --> 00:00:25.780
对于垃圾邮件

18
00:00:22.964 --> 00:00:25.780
And for the spam email model, let's see.

19
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.054
假阴性是指垃圾邮件进入了收件箱

20
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.054
A false negative means a spam email made its way into your inbox,

21
00:00:29.054 --> 00:00:30.519
你只需将其删掉

22
00:00:29.054 --> 00:00:30.519
and all you have to do is delete it.

23
00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.439
因此不太方便

24
00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.439
So it's a bit of an inconvenience.

25
00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.484
另一方面假阳性是什么情况呢？

26
00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.484
On the other hand, what's a false positive?

27
00:00:34.484 --> 00:00:37.799
Your grandma, the poor lady learned to type an email only to tell

28
00:00:34.484 --> 00:00:37.799
可怜的外婆学会了发电子邮件

29
00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:41.544
只为了告诉你她做了一些曲奇 但是你给删了 太可怕了

30
00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:41.544
you she baked cookies and you delete it. That's terrible.

31
00:00:41.545 --> 00:00:45.689
因此我们希望假阳性的惩罚比假阴性的更重

32
00:00:41.545 --> 00:00:45.689
So here, we want to punish false positives more than false negatives.

33
00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:47.474
这个模型的含义是

34
00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:47.474
So this model basically says,

35
00:00:47.475 --> 00:00:50.145
我并不关心是否找到了所有的垃圾邮件

36
00:00:47.475 --> 00:00:50.145
I don't really care if I find all the spam emails,

37
00:00:50.145 --> 00:00:51.585
但有一点值得肯定的是

38
00:00:50.145 --> 00:00:51.585
but one thing is for sure,

39
00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:54.975
如果说某封邮件是垃圾邮件 则最好是垃圾邮件

40
00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:54.975
if I say that an email is spam, it better be spam.

41
00:00:54.975 --> 00:00:59.075
因此 医疗模型和电子邮件模型在本质上是完全不同的

42
00:00:54.975 --> 00:00:59.075
So as we can see, the medical model and the email model are fundamentally different.

43
00:00:59.075 --> 00:01:01.980
The medical model as we saw is okay with false positives,

44
00:00:59.075 --> 00:01:01.980
医疗模型可以接受假阳性

45
00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:03.549
but not with false negatives.

46
00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:03.549
但不能接受假阴性

47
00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:05.700
Since we're okay misdiagnosing some patients

48
00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:05.700
因为我们可以将某人误诊为生病人士

49
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.325
只要找到所有生病人士即可

50
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.325
as sick as long as we find all the sick people.

51
00:01:08.325 --> 00:01:09.689
另一方面

52
00:01:08.325 --> 00:01:09.689
The email model on the other hand,

53
00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.299
is okay with false negatives but not with false positives,

54
00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.299
邮件模型可以接受假阴性 但不能接受假阳性

55
00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.649
因为我们不需要找到所有的垃圾邮件

56
00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.649
since we don't necessarily need to find all the spam emails.

57
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.205
但有一定可以肯定的是

58
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.205
But one thing is for sure,

59
00:01:17.204 --> 00:01:20.635
that if we do label something as spam, it better be spam.

60
00:01:17.204 --> 00:01:20.635
如果将某个邮件标记为垃圾邮件 则最好是垃圾邮件

61
00:01:20.635 --> 00:01:24.090
我们将介绍两种指标 精度和召回率

62
00:01:20.635 --> 00:01:24.090
For this, we introduce use two metrics, precision and recall.

63
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.795
They will measure the exact things that we want namely,

64
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.795
它们将能够衡量我们想衡量的内容

65
00:01:27.795 --> 00:01:30.765
the medical model needs to be a high-recall model,

66
00:01:27.795 --> 00:01:30.765
即医疗模型需要是高召回率模型

67
00:01:30.765 --> 00:01:34.200
and the email model needs to be a high-precision model.

68
00:01:30.765 --> 00:01:34.200
电子邮件模型需要是高精度模型

69
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.000
We'll talk about them more in detail in the next couple of videos.

70
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.000
我们将在接下来的几个视频中详细讲解这两个概念
