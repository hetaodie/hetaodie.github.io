1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.365
Now, accuracy may not always be the best metric to use.

2
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.365
准确率并非始终是最佳指标

3
00:00:03.365 --> 00:00:05.054
我们看一个示例

4
00:00:03.365 --> 00:00:05.054
Let's look at this example.

5
00:00:05.054 --> 00:00:07.615
该示例是检测信用卡欺诈行为

6
00:00:05.054 --> 00:00:07.615
It consists of detecting credit card fraud.

7
00:00:07.615 --> 00:00:10.740
So we have a bunch of data in the form of credit card transactions,

8
00:00:07.615 --> 00:00:10.740
有一堆信用卡交易数据

9
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.794
有些数据是良好的数据 例如左侧的数据

10
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.794
and some of them are good like the ones on the left,

11
00:00:12.794 --> 00:00:15.870
and some of them are fraudulent like the ones in the right.

12
00:00:12.794 --> 00:00:15.870
有些是欺诈行为 例如右侧的数据

13
00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:17.160
我们来看看数字

14
00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:17.160
So let's look at the numbers.

15
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.300
There are 284,335 good transactions,

16
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.300
有 284,335 条良好的交易

17
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.570
和 472 条欺诈性交易

18
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.570
and 472 fraudulent transactions.

19
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.835
这其实是现实生活中的数据

20
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.835
This is actually real data.

21
00:00:25.835 --> 00:00:28.260
我们试着找出一个准确率很高的模型

22
00:00:25.835 --> 00:00:28.260
So let's try to come up with a model that has great accuracy.

23
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.165
即大部分时间都正确的模型

24
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.165
So a model that is correct most of the time.

25
00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:36.479
能想到准确率超过 99% 的模型吗？

26
00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:36.479
Can you help me think of a model that has over 99% accuracy?

27
00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:39.359
So here's a model that has over 99% accuracy,

28
00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:39.359
下面描述下准确率超过 99% 的模型

29
00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:42.494
也就是超过 99% 的时间都正确

30
00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:42.494
which means it is correct over 99% of the time.

31
00:00:42.494 --> 00:00:46.679
模型说 所有交易都是良好的交易

32
00:00:42.494 --> 00:00:46.679
The model says, all the transactions are good.

33
00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:48.750
这个模型的准确率是多少

34
00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:48.750
Now, what is the accuracy of this model namely,

35
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.195
即多少次是正确的？

36
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.195
how many times are we correct?

37
00:00:51.195 --> 00:01:00.359
284,887 次中有 284,335 次是正确的

38
00:00:51.195 --> 00:01:00.359
Well, we're correct 284,335 times out of 384,887 times.

39
00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.945
结果是 99.83%

40
00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.945
And that is 99.83%.

41
00:01:03.945 --> 00:01:06.769
So this model must be pretty good if it's accurate that high, right?

42
00:01:03.945 --> 00:01:06.769
所以这个模型肯定很不错 因为准确率如此的高 对吧？

43
00:01:06.769 --> 00:01:10.659
实际并非这样 该模型没有发现任何不好的数据

44
00:01:06.769 --> 00:01:10.659
Well, not really. This model is not catching any of the bad ones.

45
00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.484
And the point of the model is to catch the fraudulent transactions.

46
00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.484
模型的意义就是发现欺诈交易

47
00:01:14.484 --> 00:01:18.269
So let's look at another model. To get a model that catches all the bad transactions.

48
00:01:14.484 --> 00:01:18.269
我们再看看另一个模型 能获得发现所有欺诈交易的模型吗？

49
00:01:18.269 --> 00:01:19.894
Can we think of one?

50
00:01:18.269 --> 00:01:19.894
我们能想到一个吗？

51
00:01:19.894 --> 00:01:23.075
Well here's one, I'm going to label all transactions fraudulent.

52
00:01:19.894 --> 00:01:23.075
下面介绍一个 我将所有交易标记为欺诈行为

53
00:01:23.075 --> 00:01:25.350
很棒了吧？我们发现了所有的欺诈交易

54
00:01:23.075 --> 00:01:25.350
So that's great, right? Now we're catching

55
00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:28.519
是好的模型吗？

56
00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:28.519
all the fraudulent transactions. Now, is that a good model?

57
00:01:28.519 --> 00:01:30.959
答案是否定的 也是一个糟糕的模型

58
00:01:28.519 --> 00:01:30.959
Well, no that's also a terrible model since it's accidentally

59
00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:33.750
catching all the good ones. So it's pretty tricky, right?

60
00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:33.750
因为将所有好的交易也标记为欺诈交易 很棘手吧

61
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.424
仅通过准确率来评估模型比较棘手

62
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.424
It's pretty tricky to just look at accuracy and use that to evaluate our model,

63
00:01:37.424 --> 00:01:41.459
because it may completely miss the point when the data is skewed like this one.

64
00:01:37.424 --> 00:01:41.459
因为对于这样偏斜的数据集 可能会完全忽略一些点

65
00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:46.000
So in this section, we'll study some different metrics that can catch this more easily.

66
00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:46.000
在这部分 我们将学习一些不同的指标 可以更轻松地发现这类点
