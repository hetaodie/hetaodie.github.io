1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,140
So, let's define the Precision metric as follows.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,759
Here is the Confusion matrix of the medical model.

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,119
And we've added a red X in the spot that we really want to avoid,

4
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:10,609
which is the false negatives.

5
00:00:10,609 --> 00:00:12,949
So Precision will be the answer to a question out of

6
00:00:12,949 --> 00:00:15,739
all the points predicted to be positive,

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,469
how many of them were actually positive?

8
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:22,229
In this case, the question translates to,

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,469
out of all the patients that we diagnosed as sick,

10
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:28,109
how many were actually sick?

11
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:29,399
So Precision is this column,

12
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:33,210
because this column are the sick patients that we diagnosed as sick.

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,590
So it is 1000 that were correct divided by 1800,

14
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,990
which is the total number of patients diagnosed as sick.

15
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,715
This number is 55.7%.

16
00:00:44,715 --> 00:00:47,715
It's not a high number because this is not a very precise model.

17
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:52,800
But again, this is okay because what we're doing is avoiding this red X.

18
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,309
Now, let's look at the spam e-mail model. What is this Precision?

19
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,984
Now, know that in this model Precision is very important,

20
00:00:59,984 --> 00:01:02,865
because the red X that we're avoiding is in this column.

21
00:01:02,865 --> 00:01:07,079
The red X is the non-spam emails that were accidentally sent to the spam folder.

22
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:10,914
So those 30 errors are really bad and we want to avoid them.

23
00:01:10,915 --> 00:01:12,210
So again, Precision says,

24
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:14,250
out of all the e-mails sent to the spam folder,

25
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,489
how many of them were actually spam?

26
00:01:16,489 --> 00:01:19,362
So we have 100, which are correct,

27
00:01:19,362 --> 00:01:21,450
divide it by 130,

28
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,505
which is all the ones we've sent to the spam folder.

29
00:01:24,504 --> 00:01:28,379
This number is 76.9% which is higher.

30
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:31,015
This is better, since this model needs high Precision,

31
00:01:31,015 --> 00:01:33,055
so the number better be big.

32
00:01:33,055 --> 00:01:34,755
Now, let's do an exercise.

33
00:01:34,754 --> 00:01:37,030
Let's go to our linear model over here.

34
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,504
What is the Precision of this linear model?

35
00:01:39,504 --> 00:01:42,000
Enter your answer below.
