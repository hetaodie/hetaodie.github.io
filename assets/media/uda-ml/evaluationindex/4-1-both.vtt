00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
Now, we'll study one of the ways to measure how good a model is,

2
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.449
现在我们来学习衡量模型性能的一种方式

3
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.695
called that the accuracy.

4
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:04.810
称为“准确度”

5
00:00:04.695 --> 00:00:06.820
The accuracy is the answer to the question,

6
00:00:04.809 --> 00:00:05.833
准确度就是下面这个问题的答案

7
00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:10.410
在所有就诊者中 我们正确分类的有多少？

8
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.335
"Out of all the patients, how many did we classify correctly?"

9
00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:13.500
The answer is, the ratio between the number of

10
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.519
答案就是 正确分类的点数和总点数

11
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.350
correctly classified points and the number of total points.

12
00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.489
之间的比例

13
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.570
In this example, we can see that we have correctly classified 9,000 patients,

14
00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:21.649
在这个例子中 可以看到我们正确分类了 9,000 名就诊者

15
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.350
which is a sum of 1,000 healthy and 8,000 sequence.

16
00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:25.409
是 1,000 名健康就诊者和 8,000 名患病者之和

17
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.040
So, the accuracy is this number divided by the total number of patients, which is 10,000.

18
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.140
所以准确度是这个数字

19
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.960
除以就诊者总数 也就是 10,000

20
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.707
所得的准确度为 90%

21
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.585
This gives us an accuracy of 90%.

22
00:00:32.707 --> 00:00:37.546
在 sklearn 中 使用 accuracy_score 函数可以很容易地计算

23
00:00:33.585 --> 00:00:38.780
Accuracy can easily be calculated as you can learn by using the accuracy score function.

24
00:00:37.546 --> 00:00:38.939
准确度

25
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.795
Now, let's see how much is the accuracy of the spam detector model?

26
00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:42.799
现在我们来看看 垃圾邮件检测器模型的准确度是多少

27
00:00:42.795 --> 00:00:44.100
This is the answer to the question,

28
00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:45.140
也就是下面这个问题的答案 在所有电子邮件中

29
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.165
"Out of all the emails, how many did we classify correctly?"

30
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.390
有多少是正确分类的？

31
00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:51.789
Since we have correctly classified 800 out of the 1,000 emails,

32
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.608
由于我们在 1,000 封邮件中正确分类了 800 封

33
00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:54.770
then the answer is 80%.

34
00:00:52.607 --> 00:00:54.579
所以答案是 80%

35
00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.939
下面来检测下你的知识掌握情况

36
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.660
Now, let's test your knowledge.

37
00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.230
In this model, what is the accuracy?

38
00:00:57.939 --> 00:01:01.129
在这个模型中 准确度是多少？

39
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.846
Please write the numbers of percentage.

40
00:01:00.846 --> 00:01:02.930
So, a number between 0 and 100.

41
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.780
请写下一个百分比 数字介于 0 到 100 之间

42
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.320
This number can have decimals.

43
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.200
可以包含小数
