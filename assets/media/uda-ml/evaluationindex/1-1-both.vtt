1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.490
So after we develop a model,

1
00:00:00.389 --> 00:00:03.730
那么在建立模型之后 我们想知道它的性能如何

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.405
we want to find out how good it is.

2
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.131
这是一个有难度的问题 但在这部分

3
00:00:04.405 --> 00:00:05.600
This is a difficult question.

4
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.750
But in this section, we'll learn

3
00:00:06.131 --> 00:00:09.635
我们将学习一些不同的指标 通过它们来了解模型的好坏

5
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.380
a few different metrics that will tell us how good our model is.

4
00:00:09.635 --> 00:00:11.519
我们来看两个主要示例

6
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.175
So we're going to look at two main examples.

5
00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.381
第一个示例中的模型用于检测特定疾病

7
00:00:12.175 --> 00:00:16.605
The first example is a model that will help us detect a particular illness,

6
00:00:16.382 --> 00:00:19.920
判断就诊者是健康还是患病

8
00:00:16.605 --> 00:00:20.575
and tell if a patient is healthy or sick.

7
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.750
第二个示例是一个垃圾邮件检测器 将帮助我们确定

9
00:00:20.575 --> 00:00:22.920
The second example will be a spam detector,

10
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.550
which will help us determine if an email is spam or not.

8
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.940
电子邮件是否为垃圾邮件

9
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.140
例如 左边

11
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.780
For example, on the left,

10
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.899
是来自奶奶的电子邮件 你不想将它标记为垃圾邮件

12
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.265
you have an email from your grandma,

13
00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:31.320
which you don't want to label a spam.

11
00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:33.670
右边很明显是一封垃圾邮件

14
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.345
On the right, you have an email that is

15
00:00:33.345 --> 00:00:36.420
clearly spam and you want to send that to the spam folder.

12
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.800
你要将其送到垃圾邮件文件夹

13
00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:38.239
我们来看看用于诊断疾病的模型

16
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.880
So let's look at the model for diagnosing an illness.

14
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.850
总共有四种情况

17
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.380
There are four possible cases.

15
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.990
当就诊者患病 且模型阳性确诊断为患病时

18
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.800
When a patient is sick,

19
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.375
and the model correctly diagnosed them as sick.

16
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.980
这是一名患者 我需要让他入院进行进一步检查或治疗

20
00:00:44.375 --> 00:00:45.550
This is a sick patient,

21
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.620
I will send in for further examination or for treatment.

17
00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:50.239
这种情况我们称之为真阳性

22
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.880
This case, we'll call a true positive.

18
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.550
当就诊者未患病 而且模型阳性确诊断为健康时

23
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.215
When a patient is healthy and the model correctly diagnosed him as healthy,

19
00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:55.679
这是一名健康就诊者 可以直接回家

24
00:00:54.215 --> 00:00:56.235
this is a healthy patient that we'll send home.

20
00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:57.789
此情况我们称之为真阴性

25
00:00:56.235 --> 00:00:58.370
This case, we call a true negative.

21
00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.664
当就诊者患病而模型错误诊断为健康时

26
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.130
When a patient is sick and the modeling correctly diagnosed them as healthy.

22
00:01:01.664 --> 00:01:02.813
这是个错误

27
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.188
This is a mistake,

23
00:01:02.813 --> 00:01:06.402
说明我们在让患者未接受治疗的情况下回家了

28
00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:07.125
and it means we'll be sending a sick patient back home with no treatment.

24
00:01:06.402 --> 00:01:08.040
这称为假阴性

29
00:01:07.125 --> 00:01:08.670
This is called a false negative.

25
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.560
最终当就诊者健康

30
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.965
And finally, when a patient is healthy and the model incorrectly diagnoses them as sick.

26
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.700
而模型错误诊断为患病时 这也是错误的

31
00:01:12.965 --> 00:01:14.130
This is also a mistake,

27
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.469
说明我们让一名未患病者入院进行进一步检查或治疗

32
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.120
and it means we'll be sending a healthy person for further examination or treatment.

28
00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:19.579
这称为假阳性

33
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.220
This is called a false positive.

29
00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.640
现在我们介绍一个所谓的混淆矩阵

34
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.320
Now, we'll introduce what's called the confusion matrix.

30
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.721
这是一个用于描述模型性能的表

35
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.140
This is a table that will describe the performance of a model.

31
00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:27.254
在这个模型中 我们有 10,000 个患者

36
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.005
In this model, we have 10,000 patients.

32
00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:30.670
其中有 1,000 是患病的 并且被阳性确诊断为患病

37
00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:31.255
A thousand of them are sick and have been correctly diagnosed as sick.

33
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.506
我们称之为真阳性

38
00:01:31.255 --> 00:01:33.100
We call these true positive.

34
00:01:32.506 --> 00:01:35.799
有 200 人是患病的 而被错误诊断为健康

39
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.370
200 of them are sick and have been incorrectly diagnosed them as healthy.

35
00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.525
我们称之为假阴性

40
00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.275
So we call them false negatives.

36
00:01:37.525 --> 00:01:40.938
有 800 名就诊者是健康的 而被错误诊断为患病

41
00:01:38.275 --> 00:01:41.790
800 patients are healthy and have been incorrectly diagnosed as sick.

37
00:01:40.938 --> 00:01:42.699
我们称之为假阳性

42
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.260
We call these false positives.

38
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.268
最后 有 8,000 名就诊者是健康的

43
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.740
And finally, 8,000 patients are healthy and have been correctly diagnosed as healthy.

39
00:01:45.268 --> 00:01:49.460
并被阳性确诊断为健康 我们称之为真阴性

44
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.880
We call these true negatives.

40
00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:52.649
混淆矩阵只是存储这四个值的表格

45
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.280
The confusion matrix is a simple table that stores these four values.

41
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.576
现在我们来看一下用于检测垃圾邮件的模型

46
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.290
Now let's look at the model for detecting spam email.

42
00:01:54.575 --> 00:01:56.489
共有四种可能的情况

47
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.835
There are four possible cases.

43
00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:59.309
当我们收到垃圾邮件 并且分类器阳性确地将其发送到我们的垃圾邮件

48
00:01:56.835 --> 00:01:59.300
When we get a spam email and the classifier sends it to

49
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.230
a spam folder correctly, which is a true positive.

44
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.600
文件夹时 这为真阳性

45
00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:02.609
当我们收到垃圾邮件

50
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.615
When we get a spam email and the classifier incorrectly sends it to our inbox,

46
00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:06.670
而分类器错误地将其发送到我们的收件箱时 这为假阴性

51
00:02:05.615 --> 00:02:07.270
this is a false negative.

47
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.500
当我们收到奶奶的阳性常邮件 而分类器

52
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.730
When we get a good email, for example,

53
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:12.360
from our grandma and the classifier incorrectly sends it to our spam folder,

48
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.259
错误地将它发送到我们的垃圾邮件文件夹时 此为假阳性

54
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.920
this is called a false positive.

49
00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:14.599
最后 当我们收到阳性常邮件

55
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.595
And finally, when we get a good email the classifier correctly sends it to our inbox,

50
00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.109
分类器阳性确地将其发送到我们的收件箱时 此为真阴性

56
00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:19.355
which is a true negative.

51
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.730
我们也可以找到这个模型的混淆矩阵

57
00:02:19.355 --> 00:02:22.365
And we can also find the confusion matrix for this model.

52
00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:23.469
这里共有 1000 封电子邮件

58
00:02:22.365 --> 00:02:24.135
Here, we have a pool of a thousand emails.

53
00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:24.453
其中

59
00:02:24.135 --> 00:02:27.845
Out of these emails, 100 spam emails have been correctly sent to the spam folder.

54
00:02:24.453 --> 00:02:27.215
100 封垃圾邮件被阳性确发送到垃圾邮件文件夹

55
00:02:27.215 --> 00:02:30.747
170 封垃圾邮件被错误发送到收件箱中

60
00:02:27.845 --> 00:02:31.463
170 spam emails have been incorrectly sent to the inbox.

56
00:02:30.747 --> 00:02:34.198
30 封非垃圾邮件被错误发送到垃圾邮件文件夹

61
00:02:31.463 --> 00:02:34.880
30 non-spam emails have been incorrectly sent to the spam folder.

57
00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:38.530
最后 700 封非垃圾邮件被阳性确发送到收件箱中

62
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.175
And finally, 700 non-spam emails have been correctly sent to the inbox.

58
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.469
这是它的混淆矩阵

63
00:02:39.175 --> 00:02:41.100
So here is the confusion matrix.

59
00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:42.680
现在轮到你创建一个混淆矩阵了

64
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.280
Now it's your turn to create a confusion matrix.

60
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.498
看看这些数据 其中蓝点为阳性

65
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.960
Look at this data where the blue points are positive,

61
00:02:45.497 --> 00:02:47.036
红点为阴性

66
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.760
and the red points are negative.

62
00:02:47.036 --> 00:02:50.816
我们训练的模型是一条将它们分开的直线 阳性点区域

67
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.250
The model we've trained is the line that separates them,

68
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.530
with the positive region being in the top,

63
00:02:50.816 --> 00:02:54.210
在上 阴性点区域在下

69
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.840
and the negative region in the bottom.

64
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.740
现在 填写以下混淆矩阵中的四个空白处

70
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.910
Now please fill in the following four blanks in

71
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.990
the confusion matrix for number of true positives,

65
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.620
分别写上真阳性、真阴性、假阳性

72
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.050
true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

66
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.430
和假阴性
