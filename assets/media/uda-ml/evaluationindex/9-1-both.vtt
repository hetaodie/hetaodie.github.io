1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.140
So, let's define the Precision metric as follows.

2
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.140
精度指标的定义如下

3
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.759
下面是医疗模型的混淆矩阵

4
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.759
Here is the Confusion matrix of the medical model.

5
00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.119
我们用红色叉号表示要务必避免的情形

6
00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.119
And we've added a red X in the spot that we really want to avoid,

7
00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:10.609
which is the false negatives.

8
00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:10.609
即假阴性

9
00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:12.949
精度可以帮助回答

10
00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:12.949
So Precision will be the answer to a question out of

11
00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:15.739
all the points predicted to be positive,

12
00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:15.739
在所有预测为阳性的点中

13
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.469
有多少是真阳性的点？

14
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.469
how many of them were actually positive?

15
00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:22.229
In this case, the question translates to,

16
00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:22.229
在这种情况下 该问题就相当于

17
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.469
在诊断为生病的所有患者当中

18
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.469
out of all the patients that we diagnosed as sick,

19
00:00:25.469 --> 00:00:28.109
有多少位真正的生病了？

20
00:00:25.469 --> 00:00:28.109
how many were actually sick?

21
00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.399
精度是这列

22
00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.399
So Precision is this column,

23
00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:33.210
因为这列是诊断为生病的患者

24
00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:33.210
because this column are the sick patients that we diagnosed as sick.

25
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.590
也就是 1000（诊断正确的人数）除以 1800

26
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.590
So it is 1000 that were correct divided by 1800,

27
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.990
which is the total number of patients diagnosed as sick.

28
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.990
即所有诊断为生病的患者人数

29
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.715
结果是 55.6%

30
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.715
This number is 55.7%.

31
00:00:44.715 --> 00:00:47.715
数字不太大 因为不是很精确的模型

32
00:00:44.715 --> 00:00:47.715
It's not a high number because this is not a very precise model.

33
00:00:47.715 --> 00:00:52.800
但可以接受 因为我们要避免这个红色 X

34
00:00:47.715 --> 00:00:52.800
But again, this is okay because what we're doing is avoiding this red X.

35
00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:56.309
现在看看垃圾邮件模型 精度是多少？

36
00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:56.309
Now, let's look at the spam e-mail model. What is this Precision?

37
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.984
在这个模型中 精度很重要

38
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.984
Now, know that in this model Precision is very important,

39
00:00:59.984 --> 00:01:02.865
因为要避免的红色 X 位于这列

40
00:00:59.984 --> 00:01:02.865
because the red X that we're avoiding is in this column.

41
00:01:02.865 --> 00:01:07.079
红色 X 是不小心发送到垃圾文件夹的非垃圾邮件

42
00:01:02.865 --> 00:01:07.079
The red X is the non-spam emails that were accidentally sent to the spam folder.

43
00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:10.914
So those 30 errors are really bad and we want to avoid them.

44
00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:10.914
这 30 个错误很糟糕 我们需要避免它们

45
00:01:10.915 --> 00:01:12.210
So again, Precision says,

46
00:01:10.915 --> 00:01:12.210
精度表示

47
00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:14.250
out of all the e-mails sent to the spam folder,

48
00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:14.250
在所有发送到垃圾文件夹的电子邮件当中

49
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.489
有多少实际上是垃圾邮件？

50
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.489
how many of them were actually spam?

51
00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:19.362
也就是 100（正确分类的垃圾邮件）

52
00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:19.362
So we have 100, which are correct,

53
00:01:19.362 --> 00:01:21.450
divide it by 130,

54
00:01:19.362 --> 00:01:21.450
除以 130

55
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.505
即发送到垃圾文件夹的所有邮件

56
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.505
which is all the ones we've sent to the spam folder.

57
00:01:24.504 --> 00:01:28.379
结果是 76.9% 更高了

58
00:01:24.504 --> 00:01:28.379
This number is 76.9% which is higher.

59
00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:31.015
This is better, since this model needs high Precision,

60
00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:31.015
这样更好 因为这个模型需要高精度

61
00:01:31.015 --> 00:01:33.055
因此这个数字最好很大

62
00:01:31.015 --> 00:01:33.055
so the number better be big.

63
00:01:33.055 --> 00:01:34.755
Now, let's do an exercise.

64
00:01:33.055 --> 00:01:34.755
现在做道练习

65
00:01:34.754 --> 00:01:37.030
Let's go to our linear model over here.

66
00:01:34.754 --> 00:01:37.030
转到这里的线性模型

67
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.504
What is the Precision of this linear model?

68
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.504
该线性模型的精度是多少？

69
00:01:39.504 --> 00:01:42.000
Enter your answer below.

70
00:01:39.504 --> 00:01:42.000
