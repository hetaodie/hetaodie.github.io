00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.929
So let's go back to our two examples,

2
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.929
看看我们的两个示例

3
00:00:01.929 --> 00:00:03.599
医疗模型和垃圾邮件模型

4
00:00:01.929 --> 00:00:03.599
the Medical Model and Spam E-mail Model.

5
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.919
对于医疗模型 有四种可能性

6
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.919
Recalled for the medical model we have four possibilities.

7
00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.320
A true positive, which is when

8
00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.320
真阳性 即患者生病了

9
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.765
我们正确地诊断出他生病了

10
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.765
the patient is sick and we correctly diagnosed him as sick.

11
00:00:13.765 --> 00:00:16.350
A true negative, which is when the patient is

12
00:00:13.765 --> 00:00:16.350
真阴性 患者没生病

13
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.075
我们正确地诊断为他没生病

14
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.075
not sick and we correctly diagnosed him as not sick.

15
00:00:20.074 --> 00:00:21.869
A false positive, which is when a patient is

16
00:00:20.074 --> 00:00:21.869
假阳性 患者很健康

17
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.005
我们错误地诊断为生病了

18
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.005
healthy and we incorrectly diagnosed him as sick.

19
00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:26.489
最后是假阴性

20
00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:26.489
And finally, a false negative,

21
00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:30.625
患者生病了 我们错误地诊断为很健康

22
00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:30.625
which is when the patient is sick and we incorrectly diagnosed him as healthy.

23
00:00:30.625 --> 00:00:34.289
我们忽略两个正确的情形 只关注错误的情形

24
00:00:30.625 --> 00:00:34.289
Now let's forget about the two correct ones and focus only on the mistakes.

25
00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:36.255
下面是个小测验

26
00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:36.255
Below we'll have a quiz.

27
00:00:36.255 --> 00:00:37.920
Which one do you think is worse,

28
00:00:36.255 --> 00:00:37.920
哪个情况更糟糕

29
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.010
假阳性或假阴性？

30
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.010
a false positive or a false negative?

31
00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:44.339
换句话说 将健康人士误诊为生病了

32
00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:44.339
In other words, what is a worse mistake to misdiagnose

33
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.055
或者将生病的患者诊断为健康人士 哪种情况更糟糕？

34
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.055
a healthy patient as sick or a sick patient as healthy?

35
00:00:48.054 --> 00:00:49.524
回到另一个模型

36
00:00:48.054 --> 00:00:49.524
Now let's go back to our other model,

37
00:00:49.524 --> 00:00:50.804
即垃圾邮件模型

38
00:00:49.524 --> 00:00:50.804
the Spam E-mail Model.

39
00:00:50.804 --> 00:00:51.990
我们有两封邮件

40
00:00:50.804 --> 00:00:51.990
So we have two emails,

41
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.240
一个是祖母发来的非垃圾邮件 告诉我们她烘焙了一些曲奇

42
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.240
one non-spam from a grandmother telling us she baked

43
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.300
cookies and one spam from a questionable source.

44
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.300
另一封是可疑人员发来的垃圾邮件

45
00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:58.909
对于这个模型

46
00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:58.909
Recall that for this model,

47
00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:00.819
we again have four possibilities.

48
00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:00.819
也有四种情况

49
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.325
A true positive, which is when the spam e-mail gets correctly sent into the spam folder.

50
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.325
真阳性即垃圾邮件正确地发送到垃圾文件夹

51
00:01:05.325 --> 00:01:06.816
真阴性 即祖母的邮件

52
00:01:05.325 --> 00:01:06.816
A true negative, which is when

53
00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:09.870
our grandmother's e-mail gets correctly send to the Inbox folder.

54
00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:09.870
正确地发送到了收件箱文件夹里

55
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.969
A false positive, which is when the grandmother's e-mail

56
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.969
假阴性 即祖母的邮件

57
00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:14.465
accidentally gets sent to the spam folder.

58
00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:14.465
不小心发送到了垃圾文件夹里

59
00:01:14.465 --> 00:01:15.659
And finally, a false negative,

60
00:01:14.465 --> 00:01:15.659
最后是假阴性

61
00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.140
即垃圾邮件不小心发送到了收件箱里

62
00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.140
which is when a spam e-mail accidentally gets sent to our inbox.

63
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.094
我们再次忽略正确的情形并仅侧重于错误的情形

64
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.094
Now again, let's forget about the two correct ones and focus only on the mistakes.

65
00:01:23.094 --> 00:01:24.980
So below there will be another quiz.

66
00:01:23.094 --> 00:01:24.980
下面是另一道测验

67
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.475
Which one do you think is worse,

68
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.475
你觉得哪种情况更糟糕

69
00:01:26.474 --> 00:01:29.369
a false positive or a false negative?

70
00:01:26.474 --> 00:01:29.369
假阳性或假阴性？

71
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.380
In other words, what is a worst mistake?

72
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.380
换句话说 哪个错误最糟糕？

73
00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:33.420
To accidentally send your grandmother's e-mail to

74
00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:33.420
不小心将祖母的电子邮件发送到垃圾文件夹

75
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.085
the spam folder or to accidentally send the spam e-mail into your inbox?

76
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.085
或不小心将垃圾邮件发到收件箱里？

77
00:01:38.084 --> 00:01:40.809
Enter your answers below.

78
00:01:38.084 --> 00:01:40.809
