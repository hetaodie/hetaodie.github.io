00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
>>Now, we'll learn another technique to evaluate a model called

2
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
现在我们将学习另一个评估模型的技巧

3
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.144
叫做受试者工作特性曲线 简称 ROC 曲线

4
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.144
the Receiver Operator Characteristic curve or ROC curve for short,

5
00:00:07.144 --> 00:00:09.119
它的工作原理如下

6
00:00:07.144 --> 00:00:09.119
and it works as follows.

7
00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:11.399
Consider this data which is now one dimensional,

8
00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:11.399
有一组数据 现在是一维的

9
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.050
所有红点和蓝点都在一条直线上

10
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.050
so all the red and blue points lie in one line,

11
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.455
and we want to find the correct split.

12
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.455
我们想要找到正确的拆分方法

13
00:00:16.454 --> 00:00:19.034
可以在这里拆分

14
00:00:16.454 --> 00:00:19.034
So, we can have a split like around here,

15
00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:21.405
or maybe here, or here.

16
00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:21.405
这里或这里

17
00:00:21.405 --> 00:00:22.730
都是很好的拆分位置

18
00:00:21.405 --> 00:00:22.730
All of them are good splits.

19
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.039
我们称其为好的拆分

20
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.039
So, we'll call this a good split.

21
00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.539
现在看看这组数据 看出可以在这里完美地拆分

22
00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.539
Now, we can look at this data which as you can see is perfectly separable over here.

23
00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.640
我们称其为完美拆分

24
00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.640
So, we'll call that a perfect split.

25
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.310
最后是这个非常随机的数据

26
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.310
And finally, we have this data over here which is pretty much random,

27
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.594
and there's not much to split here.

28
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.594
没有可拆分的位置

29
00:00:37.594 --> 00:00:39.240
似乎在任何地方放置界线

30
00:00:37.594 --> 00:00:39.240
It seems that anywhere we put the boundary,

31
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.500
每侧都有一半的蓝点

32
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.500
we'll have about half blue,

33
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.409
和一半的红点

34
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.409
half red points on each side.

35
00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:45.579
So, we'll call that a bad split or a random split.

36
00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:45.579
我们称其为坏的拆分或随机拆分

37
00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.399
现在要做的是得出一个指标或数字

38
00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.399
And now what we want is to come up with a metric or

39
00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.964
对于完美拆分来说很高

40
00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.964
some number that is high for the perfect split,

41
00:00:49.965 --> 00:00:51.570
对于好的拆分来说中等大小

42
00:00:49.965 --> 00:00:51.570
medium for the good split,

43
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.335
and low for the random split.

44
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.335
对于随机拆分来说很低

45
00:00:53.335 --> 00:00:56.365
实际上 让完美拆分的得分为 1

46
00:00:53.335 --> 00:00:56.365
In fact, something that gives the perfect split a score of one,

47
00:00:56.365 --> 00:00:58.965
the good split something around 0.8,

48
00:00:56.365 --> 00:00:58.965
好的拆分在 0.8 左右

49
00:00:58.965 --> 00:01:02.060
随机拆分在 0.5 左右

50
00:00:58.965 --> 00:01:02.060
and the random split something around 0.5.

51
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.879
That's where the ROC curve will help us.

52
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.879
这时候 ROC 曲线就能派上用场了

53
00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.405
我们看看如何构建这些数字

54
00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.405
So, let's see how to construct these numbers.

55
00:01:06.405 --> 00:01:10.165
Let's take our good data and let's cut it over here.

56
00:01:06.405 --> 00:01:10.165
我们看看好的数据 在这里拆分

57
00:01:10.165 --> 00:01:12.300
Now, we'll calculate two ratios.

58
00:01:10.165 --> 00:01:12.300
现在计算两个比例

59
00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.399
The first one is a true positive rate, which means,

60
00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.399
第一个是真阳性比例

61
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.160
即在所有阳性标记的点中

62
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.160
out of all the positively labeled points,

63
00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.979
有多少点分类正确？

64
00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.979
how many did we classify correctly?

65
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.960
也就是真阳性的点数量

66
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.960
That means, the number of true positives,

67
00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:25.849
divided by the total number of positively labeled points.

68
00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:25.849
除以阳性标记的点总数

69
00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:27.780
看看结果是多少

70
00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:27.780
So, let's see how much this is.

71
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.224
There are seven positively labeled numbers,

72
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.224
有 7 个阳性标记的数字

73
00:01:30.224 --> 00:01:33.329
and six of them have been correctly labeled positive.

74
00:01:30.224 --> 00:01:33.329
其中 6 个正确地标记为阳性

75
00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.569
So, this ratio is six out of seven, or 0.857.

76
00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.569
比例是 6/7 等于 0.857

77
00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:44.836
现在看看假阳性比例 即在所有阴性点中

78
00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:44.836
Now, let's look at the false positive rate which means out of all the negative points,

79
00:01:44.837 --> 00:01:49.250
how many of them did the model incorrectly think they were positives?

80
00:01:44.837 --> 00:01:49.250
模型错误地认为有多少点是阳性的

81
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.984
So out of the seven negatively labeled points,

82
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.984
在 7 个阴性标记的点中

83
00:01:52.984 --> 00:01:55.950
模型认为有 2 个是阳性的

84
00:01:52.984 --> 00:01:55.950
the model thought two of them were positive.

85
00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.320
So the false positive rate is two out of seven, or 0.286.

86
00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.320
因此假阳性比例是 2/7 等于 0.286

87
00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:04.689
And we'll just remember these two numbers.

88
00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:04.689
我们只需记住这两个数字

89
00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.000
Now, what we'll do,

90
00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.000
我们要做的是

91
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.995
is we'll move this boundary around and calculate the same pair of numbers.

92
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.995
四处移动这个界线 并计算相同的数字对

93
00:02:10.995 --> 00:02:12.990
放在这里

94
00:02:10.995 --> 00:02:12.990
So, let's play it over here.

95
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.305
真阳性比例是多少？

96
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.305
What is the true positive rate over here?

97
00:02:15.305 --> 00:02:17.830
Well, the model thinks everything is positive.

98
00:02:15.305 --> 00:02:17.830
模型认为所有点都是阳性的

99
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.580
因此所有阳性点都是真的阳性

100
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.580
So in particular, all the positives are true positives.

101
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.005
真阳性比例是 7/7 等于 1

102
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.005
So, the true positive rate is seven divided by seven, which is one.

103
00:02:25.004 --> 00:02:27.000
And for the false positive rate.

104
00:02:25.004 --> 00:02:27.000
对于假阳性比例

105
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.534
Well, since the model thinks everything is positive,

106
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.534
因为模型认为所有点都是阳性

107
00:02:29.534 --> 00:02:32.014
then all the negatives are false positive.

108
00:02:29.534 --> 00:02:32.014
因此所有阴性都是假阳性

109
00:02:32.014 --> 00:02:37.949
So, the false positive rate is again seven divided by seven, which is one.

110
00:02:32.014 --> 00:02:37.949
因此假阳性比例是 7/7 等于 1

111
00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:41.969
记住这两个值 1 和 1

112
00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:41.969
So again, we'll remember these two values one and one.

113
00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:43.375
再看看另一个极端情况

114
00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:43.375
And now let's go to the other extreme.

115
00:02:43.375 --> 00:02:47.860
将界线放在这里 现在看看真阳性比例

116
00:02:43.375 --> 00:02:47.860
Let's put the bar over here and now let's see what is the true positive rate.

117
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.560
模型认为所有点都不是阳性

118
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.560
Well, the model thinks nothing is positive.

119
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.284
So in particular, there are no true positives and the ratio is zero divided by seven,

120
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.284
因此没有真阳性 比例是 0/7 等于 0

121
00:02:54.284 --> 00:02:56.900
which is zero. And for the false positive rate?

122
00:02:54.284 --> 00:02:56.900
那么假阳性比例呢？

123
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.985
Well, again, the model thinks nothing is positive,

124
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.985
模型认为没有点是阳性

125
00:02:59.985 --> 00:03:01.455
因此没有假阳性

126
00:02:59.985 --> 00:03:01.455
so there are no false positives.

127
00:03:01.455 --> 00:03:05.175
比例是 0/7 等于 0

128
00:03:01.455 --> 00:03:05.175
And the ratio is zero over seven, which again is zero.

129
00:03:05.175 --> 00:03:07.219
记住这两个数字

130
00:03:05.175 --> 00:03:07.219
And we'll remember these two numbers.

131
00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:09.939
We can see that no matter how the data looks,

132
00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:09.939
可以看出无论数据是怎样的

133
00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.284
两个极端始终为 (1,1)

134
00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.284
the two extremes will always be one,

135
00:03:13.284 --> 00:03:15.449
和 (0,0)

136
00:03:13.284 --> 00:03:15.449
one and zero, zero.

137
00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:20.069
现在可以计算所有可能的拆分情况 并记下这些数字

138
00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:20.069
And now, we can do this for every possible split and record those numbers.

139
00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.340
我们计算出了几个值

140
00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.340
So here we have a few of them that we've calculated.

141
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.050
现在比较神奇的是

142
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.050
And now, the magic happens.

143
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.735
We just pluck these numbers in the plane, and we get a curve.

144
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.735
我们将这些数字代入平面里 得出了一条曲线

145
00:03:27.735 --> 00:03:32.275
我们计算曲线下方的面积 大约是 0.8

146
00:03:27.735 --> 00:03:32.275
And now, we calculate the area under the curve and here we get around 0.8.

147
00:03:32.275 --> 00:03:34.965
不太准确 但是大概这么多

148
00:03:32.275 --> 00:03:34.965
This is actually not accurate, but it's around there.

149
00:03:34.965 --> 00:03:37.740
You can calculate it on your own and see how much you get.

150
00:03:34.965 --> 00:03:37.740
你可以自己计算下 看看结果是多少

151
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.064
我们现在对完美拆分执行相同的流程

152
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.064
So now, let's do the same thing for the perfect split.

153
00:03:40.064 --> 00:03:41.919
这是所有的比例结果

154
00:03:40.064 --> 00:03:41.919
Here are all the ratios.

155
00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:43.994
注意如果界线在红色那一侧

156
00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:43.994
Notice that the boundary is on the red side,

157
00:03:43.995 --> 00:03:45.855
and the true positive ratio is

158
00:03:43.995 --> 00:03:45.855
真阳性比例是 1

159
00:03:45.854 --> 00:03:49.334
因为每个阳性点都被预测为阳性

160
00:03:45.854 --> 00:03:49.334
one since every positive number has been predicted positive.

161
00:03:49.335 --> 00:03:52.439
类似地 如果界线在蓝色一侧

162
00:03:49.335 --> 00:03:52.439
Similarly, if the boundaries on the blue side then every negative number

163
00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:56.324
has been predicted negative and so the false positive ratio is zero.

164
00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:56.324
那么所有阴性点都被预测为阴性 因此假阳性比例是 0

165
00:03:56.324 --> 00:03:58.739
尤其是 在完美拆分点

166
00:03:56.324 --> 00:03:58.739
In particular, at the perfect split point,

167
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.504
结果是 (0,1)

168
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.504
we have a zero comma one.

169
00:04:00.504 --> 00:04:02.039
Thus, when we pluck these numbers,

170
00:04:00.504 --> 00:04:02.039
代入这些数字后

171
00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:04.229
the curve looks like a square,

172
00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:04.229
曲线看起来像个正方形

173
00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:07.530
and the square has area one, which means,

174
00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:07.530
正方形的面积是 1

175
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.319
the area under the ROC curve for the perfect split is one.

176
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.319
也就是完美拆分的 ROC 曲线下方的面积是 1

177
00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.275
最后看看随机拆分

178
00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.275
And finally, we do this for the random split.

179
00:04:14.275 --> 00:04:15.685
In here, you can try it on your own.

180
00:04:14.275 --> 00:04:15.685
你可以自己试试

181
00:04:15.685 --> 00:04:20.030
But basically, since every split leaves on each side around half blue, half red points,

182
00:04:15.685 --> 00:04:20.030
因为每种拆分都让每侧一半的蓝点和一半的红点

183
00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:22.544
many pair of numbers will be close to each other,

184
00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:22.544
很多数字对都将相互接近

185
00:04:22.545 --> 00:04:24.750
and the curve will be very close to being

186
00:04:22.545 --> 00:04:24.750
曲线将非常接近

187
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.904
一个(0,0) 和 (1,1) 之间的三角形

188
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.904
just a diagonal between zero, zero and one, one.

189
00:04:27.904 --> 00:04:29.579
So if the model is random,

190
00:04:27.904 --> 00:04:29.579
如果模型是随机的

191
00:04:29.579 --> 00:04:33.779
then the area under the ROC curve is around 0.5.

192
00:04:29.579 --> 00:04:33.779
那么 ROC 曲线下方的面积约为 0.5

193
00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:36.299
So to summarize, we have three possible scenarios:

194
00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:36.299
总结下 有三个可能的情形

195
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.520
some random data which is hard to split,

196
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.520
一些难以拆分的随机数据

197
00:04:38.519 --> 00:04:42.224
一些很好拆分偶尔出现错误的良好数据

198
00:04:38.519 --> 00:04:42.224
some pretty good data which we can split well making some errors,

199
00:04:42.225 --> 00:04:46.254
以及拆分后没有错误的完美拆分数据

200
00:04:42.225 --> 00:04:46.254
and some perfectly divided data which we can split with no errors.

201
00:04:46.254 --> 00:04:48.014
And each one is associated with a curve,

202
00:04:46.254 --> 00:04:48.014
每个都有一个曲线

203
00:04:48.014 --> 00:04:52.544
and the areas under the curve are close to 0.5 for the random model.

204
00:04:48.014 --> 00:04:52.544
随机模型的曲线下面积接近 0.5

205
00:04:52.545 --> 00:04:55.131
Some are close to one for the good model,

206
00:04:52.545 --> 00:04:55.131
一些接近 1

207
00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.699
对好的模型来说大约为 0.8 完美模型是 1

208
00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.699
so around 0.8 and one for the perfect model.

209
00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:03.615
总结下 ROC 曲线下的面积越接近 1

210
00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:03.615
So in summary, the closer your area under the ROC curve is to one,

211
00:05:03.615 --> 00:05:05.920
模型就越好

212
00:05:03.615 --> 00:05:05.920
the better your model is.

213
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.786
现在提个问题

214
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.786
Now here is a question,

215
00:05:07.786 --> 00:05:12.204
can the area under the curve be less than 0.5?

216
00:05:07.786 --> 00:05:12.204
曲线下的面积可以小于 0.5 吗？

217
00:05:12.204 --> 00:05:15.384
In fact, yes, it can be all the way to zero.

218
00:05:12.204 --> 00:05:15.384
实际上可以 可以一直为 0

219
00:05:15.384 --> 00:05:18.615
How would a model look if the area under the curve is zero?

220
00:05:15.384 --> 00:05:18.615
如果曲线下面积为 0 模型该是怎样的？

221
00:05:18.615 --> 00:05:20.314
Well, it will look more backwards.

222
00:05:18.615 --> 00:05:20.314
看起来就更倒退

223
00:05:20.314 --> 00:05:22.199
It'll have more blue points in the red area,

224
00:05:20.314 --> 00:05:22.199
红色区域有更多的蓝点

225
00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:23.694
and the red points in the blue area.

226
00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:23.694
蓝色区域有更多的红点

227
00:05:23.694 --> 00:05:25.250
So maybe flipping the data may help.

228
00:05:23.694 --> 00:05:25.250
或许翻转数据会有帮助
