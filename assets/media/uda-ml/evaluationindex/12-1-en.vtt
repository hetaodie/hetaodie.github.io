00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
Now that we learned F1 score,

2
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.825
let's introduce something a bit more general. Here's the concept.

3
00:00:05.825 --> 00:00:07.395
If we have precision over here,

4
00:00:07.394 --> 00:00:08.894
and recall over here,

5
00:00:08.894 --> 00:00:11.480
then F1 score is somewhere around the middle,

6
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.410
that gives as much importance to both.

7
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.000
Of course if one of them is smaller,

8
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.059
it raises a flag but it treats them both the same.

9
00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:21.195
Now let's say our model cares a bit more about precision than recall.

10
00:00:21.195 --> 00:00:23.960
Then we want something more skewed towards precision.

11
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.350
So we'll say it's F0.5 score.

12
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.530
So we call that beta.

13
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.530
Beta is 0.5. The smaller the beta,

14
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.740
the more towards precision that we get.

15
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.005
Or if we want our model to care more about the recall than in the direction,

16
00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:38.940
we pick a larger beta, say beta equals two.

17
00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:41.484
So our metric is F2.

18
00:00:41.484 --> 00:00:43.519
If you like formulas, here they are.

19
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.655
Remember that the F1 score is two times precision,

20
00:00:46.655 --> 00:00:49.969
times recall, divided by precision plus recall.

21
00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.170
So in the formula for beta, you just introduce a beta

22
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.539
over here that will skew your formula towards either

23
00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.075
one or the other one depending on if beta is small or large. So let's see.

24
00:01:00.075 --> 00:01:02.190
If we have the fraud detection example,

25
00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:04.549
which beta should we use?

26
00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:08.340
I would initially think that this needs to be a high recall model since we need to catch

27
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.230
all the fraud cases and it's okay if we

28
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.395
accidentally detect and investigate some that are not.

29
00:01:13.394 --> 00:01:14.935
Something like F10.

30
00:01:14.935 --> 00:01:18.240
But then maybe we're sacrificing too much precision and we accidentally sending

31
00:01:18.239 --> 00:01:20.280
our customers too many notifications

32
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.590
about their transactions without them being fraudulent,

33
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.969
and they're starting to get annoyed.

34
00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:26.164
So we can move a bit toward say, F2.

35
00:01:26.165 --> 00:01:28.830
But then maybe we would discover that we need to focus a bit more on

36
00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.980
recall because we really don't want to miss too many for two transactions,

37
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.520
so we go here to F5.

38
00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:36.170
It's not an exact science.

39
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.215
Finding a good value of beta requires a lot of intuition of your data,

40
00:01:40.215 --> 00:01:42.150
and a lot of experimentation.

41
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.260
Now let's test our knowledge and let's have a quiz.

42
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.770
So let's look at three possible models.

43
00:01:46.769 --> 00:01:49.319
In the first one we are NASA and we have a model for

44
00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:52.329
detecting malfunctioning parts on a spaceship.

45
00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:56.549
In the second one, we have a video recommender system and we have a model

46
00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.049
for sending users phone notifications of our new videos they may like.

47
00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.769
In the third one we are a store,

48
00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:06.854
and we have a model for sending free samples in the mail to potential clients.

49
00:02:06.855 --> 00:02:10.707
Let's say one of them has an F beta score of F1,

50
00:02:10.707 --> 00:02:12.872
the other one is F0.5,

51
00:02:12.872 --> 00:02:14.594
and the other one is F2.

52
00:02:14.594 --> 00:02:16.430
Which one is which?

53
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.900
