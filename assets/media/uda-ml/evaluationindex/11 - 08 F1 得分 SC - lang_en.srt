1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,759
Now, we have learned precision and recall so as we've

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:06,679
seen our medical model has a precision of 55.7%,

3
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:09,519
and a recall of 83.3%.

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,524
It's supposed to be a hierarchical model.

5
00:00:11,525 --> 00:00:16,500
Our spam detector has the precision of 76.9% and a recall of 37%,

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,259
and it's supposed to be a high-precision model.

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,790
Now the question is, do we want to be carrying two numbers around all the time?

8
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:26,179
Do we want to carry precision in one pocket and recall in the other one,

9
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:27,359
and always be looking at both,

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,030
any time we make a decision?

11
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,420
Well that's inconvenient, right?

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,859
We kind of want to only have one score.

13
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:38,409
So the question is, how do we combine these two scores into one?

14
00:00:38,409 --> 00:00:40,779
Can we think of a way?

15
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,109
Well, a pretty simple way, is taking the average, right?

16
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:45,405
So let's take the average of precision and recall.

17
00:00:45,405 --> 00:00:47,880
In the left, we get 69.5%,

18
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,955
in the right, we get 56.95%.

19
00:00:50,954 --> 00:00:52,439
And that's an okay metric,

20
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:54,539
but I'm sure you're probably thinking in your head,

21
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,784
that's not very different than accuracy, right?

22
00:00:56,784 --> 00:00:58,479
That's not saying too much.

23
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:00,882
And the way to see how this average is not the best idea,

24
00:01:00,883 --> 00:01:02,510
is to try and in the extreme examples,

25
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:04,489
so the credit card fraud example.

26
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:07,709
So again, we have a bunch of good and fraudulent credit card transactions.

27
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:09,509
And let's pick a terrible model one,

28
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,900
which says, all transactions are good.

29
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,920
So what does the precision of this model?

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,980
Well the precision is, out of the ones we classified as bad,

31
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,900
how many of them are bad?

32
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,955
That's a questionable number, because we didn't label anything as fraudulent,

33
00:01:21,954 --> 00:01:24,799
so it's kind of zero divided by zero which is undefined.

34
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,965
But it makes sense to think of it as 100%, right?

35
00:01:27,965 --> 00:01:31,380
Since we made zero mistakes among the ones who predicted positive,

36
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:34,079
which is a precision tries to measure.

37
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,629
So let's say this model has a 100% precision.

38
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:38,640
Now, as for the recall, the recall is,

39
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,799
how many of the fraudulent transactions do we catch?

40
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:43,439
Well since we caught none,

41
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,054
this number is zero.

42
00:01:45,055 --> 00:01:48,045
So the average between precision and recall is 50%,

43
00:01:48,045 --> 00:01:51,180
since it's the average of a hundred and zero.

44
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,200
Now the question is, do I want to give this horrendous model of 50%?

45
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,064
It kind of seems like a really high score for such a lousy model.

46
00:01:58,064 --> 00:02:01,090
I kind of want to give it a much lower score, perhaps even zero.

47
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,049
For average is not that good. Now, let's try the opposite.

48
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:07,599
Let's try the model that says that all transactions are fraudulent.

49
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:09,859
What is the precision of this model?

50
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,745
Well, out of all the transactions that are said are fraudulent,

51
00:02:12,745 --> 00:02:15,590
472 were actually fraudulent.

52
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:22,680
So the precision is 472 divided by 284,807, which is 0.16%.

53
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,599
And the recall is actually pretty good,

54
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:29,019
because out of the 472 fraudulent transactions, I caught all of them.

55
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:34,045
So the recall is 472 divided by 472 which is 100%.

56
00:02:34,044 --> 00:02:39,524
So again, the average of the two is the average of .16 on a hundred, which is 50.08.

57
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:41,875
Again, a very high score for a really lousy model.

58
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,164
So we want to give it a lower score,

59
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:45,204
maybe something close to zero.

60
00:02:45,205 --> 00:02:47,825
So in summary, average is not the greatest thing in

61
00:02:47,824 --> 00:02:51,204
principle if either precision or recall is very low.

62
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:52,755
We want the number to be low,

63
00:02:52,754 --> 00:02:54,574
even if the other one is high.

64
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,534
So here's a solution.

65
00:02:56,534 --> 00:02:59,400
There's another type of average called the harmonic mean,

66
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,985
and it works as follows.

67
00:03:00,985 --> 00:03:04,935
Let's say we have two numbers X and Y. X is smaller than Y,

68
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,965
and we have the arithmetic mean over here.

69
00:03:07,965 --> 00:03:11,670
That is the average X plus Y divided by two.

70
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:13,709
And we have something called the harmonic mean,

71
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:18,240
which is defined by two X Y divided by X plus Y.

72
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,460
And it's kind of an average two,

73
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,224
in the sense that if the two numbers are equal,

74
00:03:21,224 --> 00:03:22,799
we get X or Y,

75
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,380
and it always lies between X and Y.

76
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,240
But actually, it's a mathematical fact that

77
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,150
the harmonic mean is always less than the arithmetic mean.

78
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,400
So it's kind of closer to the smaller number,

79
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,129
than to the higher number.

80
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:38,590
So it's a good example if the precision is one and the recall is zero.

81
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,830
The average is 0.5, but the harmonic mean is,

82
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,570
if you plug it in the formula, zero.

83
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:48,659
Another example, if the precision is 0.2 and the recall is 0.8,

84
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:50,604
then the arithmetic mean is 0.5,

85
00:03:50,604 --> 00:03:52,869
but the harmonic mean is 0.32.

86
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,259
So it closer to the lower number.

87
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:58,364
So from now on, we will not be using the average or arithmetic mean,

88
00:03:58,365 --> 00:04:00,420
but we will be using the harmonic mean.

89
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:03,319
And that's going to be called F1 score.

90
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:08,094
And as we said, the F1 score is closer to the smallest between precision and recall.

91
00:04:08,094 --> 00:04:10,094
So if one of this particularly low,

92
00:04:10,094 --> 00:04:12,900
the F1 score kind of raises a flag.

93
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,008
The average kind of says, if one is good,

94
00:04:15,008 --> 00:04:17,300
but the other one is bad, then the average is okay.

95
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,660
But the F1 score,

96
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,115
raises the flag if one of them is small.

97
00:04:21,115 --> 00:04:25,259
So we can now go back to the credit card fraud example and calculate the F1 score.

98
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:29,159
Since it's going to be the harmonic mean between the precision which is 100%,

99
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,085
and the recall which is zero.

100
00:04:31,084 --> 00:04:32,250
We can plug in the formula,

101
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,069
and actually get an F1 score of zero.

102
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:37,439
This is much closer to what the models should score.

103
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,910
So, in the following two quizzes,

104
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:43,140
we'll let you calculate the F1 score of the medical model and the spam email model.
