1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,740
So, for the medical model, it seems that we'd much rather

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:06,339
misdiagnose a healthy person as sick and send them for more tests,

3
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:10,814
than misdiagnose a sick person who's healthy and send them home without treatment.

4
00:00:10,814 --> 00:00:14,174
In this case, a false negative is much worse than a false positive.

5
00:00:14,175 --> 00:00:15,630
So the rule of this model is,

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,725
I want to find all the sick people.

7
00:00:17,725 --> 00:00:20,465
I'm okay if I accidentally bring some more as sick,

8
00:00:20,464 --> 00:00:22,964
but I need to find all the sick people.

9
00:00:22,964 --> 00:00:25,780
And for the spam email model, let's see.

10
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:29,054
A false negative means a spam email made its way into your inbox,

11
00:00:29,054 --> 00:00:30,519
and all you have to do is delete it.

12
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:32,439
So it's a bit of an inconvenience.

13
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,484
On the other hand, what's a false positive?

14
00:00:34,484 --> 00:00:37,799
Your grandma, the poor lady learned to type an email only to tell

15
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:41,544
you she baked cookies and you delete it. That's terrible.

16
00:00:41,545 --> 00:00:45,689
So here, we want to punish false positives more than false negatives.

17
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:47,474
So this model basically says,

18
00:00:47,475 --> 00:00:50,145
I don't really care if I find all the spam emails,

19
00:00:50,145 --> 00:00:51,585
but one thing is for sure,

20
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:54,975
if I say that an email is spam, it better be spam.

21
00:00:54,975 --> 00:00:59,075
So as we can see, the medical model and the email model are fundamentally different.

22
00:00:59,075 --> 00:01:01,980
The medical model as we saw is okay with false positives,

23
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,549
but not with false negatives.

24
00:01:03,549 --> 00:01:05,700
Since we're okay misdiagnosing some patients

25
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,325
as sick as long as we find all the sick people.

26
00:01:08,325 --> 00:01:09,689
The email model on the other hand,

27
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:12,299
is okay with false negatives but not with false positives,

28
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,649
since we don't necessarily need to find all the spam emails.

29
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,205
But one thing is for sure,

30
00:01:17,204 --> 00:01:20,635
that if we do label something as spam, it better be spam.

31
00:01:20,635 --> 00:01:24,090
For this, we introduce use two metrics, precision and recall.

32
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,795
They will measure the exact things that we want namely,

33
00:01:27,795 --> 00:01:30,765
the medical model needs to be a high-recall model,

34
00:01:30,765 --> 00:01:34,200
and the email model needs to be a high-precision model.

35
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,000
We'll talk about them more in detail in the next couple of videos.
