00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.512
In this section, we learn about how to train different models in

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.512
在这部分 我们学习如何训练不同的模型

2
00:00:03.512 --> 00:00:07.109
以及如何调整参数 以便更好地训练我们的模型

2
00:00:03.512 --> 00:00:07.109
a scale learn and how to play with parameters in order to train our model better.

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.894
As you can imagine, as the data gets bigger and more complicated,

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.894
可以想象出 随着数据集越庞大并且越复杂

4
00:00:09.894 --> 00:00:11.744
this process of picking the right algorithm

4
00:00:09.894 --> 00:00:11.744
选择正确算法和正确参数

5
00:00:11.744 --> 00:00:14.174
and the right parameters can get pretty tedious.

5
00:00:11.744 --> 00:00:14.174
这一流程会非常枯燥

6
00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:18.344
In fact, there are many techniques that we can use to help us with these decisions.

6
00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:18.344
实际上 有很多技巧可以帮助我们做出这些决策

7
00:00:18.344 --> 00:00:20.445
This is what we learn in the rest of this section.

7
00:00:18.344 --> 00:00:20.445
我们在这节课的后续阶段将学习这些技巧

8
00:00:20.445 --> 00:00:23.115
How to train, test, evaluate,

8
00:00:20.445 --> 00:00:23.115
如何训练 测试 评估和验证模型

9
00:00:23.114 --> 00:00:26.289
and validate models in order to make the best decisions with our data.

9
00:00:23.114 --> 00:00:26.289
以便针对我们的数据做出最佳决策
