00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.174
以下是这部分的纲要

2
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.174
Here is the outline for this section.

3
00:00:02.174 --> 00:00:04.844
In machine learning, we have a problem to solve.

4
00:00:02.174 --> 00:00:04.844
在机器学习中 我们面临着需要解决的问题

5
00:00:04.844 --> 00:00:08.910
Normally, the problem corresponds to evaluating some data and making predictions.

6
00:00:04.844 --> 00:00:08.910
通常 该问题对应的是评估一些数据并作出预测

7
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.179
问题用这个损坏的汽车表示

8
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.179
The problem is represented by this broken car over here.

9
00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.304
Now, in order to solve it,

10
00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.304
要解决该问题

11
00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:14.769
我们有几个工具

12
00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:14.769
we have a few tools.

13
00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:16.620
These tools are the algorithms,

14
00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:16.620
这些工具就是算法

15
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.200
例如线性回归 逻辑回归 SVM

16
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.200
things like linear or logistic regression, SVM's,

17
00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.369
神经网络 决策树 等等

18
00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.369
neural networks, decision trees, etc.

19
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.900
如何知道哪个工具效果最好呢？

20
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.900
How do we know which tool works best?

21
00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:27.419
Well, for that we have a bunch of measurement tools

22
00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:27.419
我们可以使用各种衡量工具

23
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.255
来评估所有的算法

24
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.255
and we use them to evaluate all the algorithms.

25
00:00:30.254 --> 00:00:32.399
Once we evaluate the algorithms and

26
00:00:30.254 --> 00:00:32.399
评估算法和算法参数

27
00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.754
their parameters and decide which ones are best for a problem,

28
00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.754
并判断哪些工具最适合解决我们的问题

29
00:00:35.755 --> 00:00:37.725
then, we go ahead and solve our problem.

30
00:00:35.755 --> 00:00:37.725
然后去解决我们的问题

31
00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:39.630
在这节课

32
00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:39.630
In this section, we learn

33
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.170
我们将学习衡量工具 即学习各种指标和技巧

34
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.170
the measurement tools so we'll learn a bunch of metrics and techniques that will

35
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.480
来判断算法何时可以有效处理数据

36
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.480
tell us when an algorithm is working well with

37
00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:49.689
如何调整算法以便获得最佳效果

38
00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:49.689
the data and how to tweak them to work best for us.
