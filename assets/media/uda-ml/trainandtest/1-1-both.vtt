Hi, and welcome to the small evaluation and validation section.

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.835
大家好 欢迎学习这个简短的评估和验证课程

2
00:00:03.835 --> 00:00:06.839
我叫 Luis Serrano 是优达学城的一名讲师

2
00:00:03.835 --> 00:00:06.839
My name is Luis Serrano and I'm an instructor here at Udacity.

3
00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.705
在这节课 我们将侧重于两个问题

3
00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.705
In this section, we'll focus on two questions.

4
00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:11.039
第一个问题是

4
00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:11.039
The first question is,

5
00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:13.479
我的模型表现如何？

5
00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:13.479
how well is my model doing?

6
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.310
假设我们已经训练了我们的机器学习模型 问题是

6
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.310
So, let's say we've trained our machine learning model and the question is,

7
00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.894
该模型效果不错吗？

7
00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.894
is this model good or not?

8
00:00:17.894 --> 00:00:22.015
So, we're going to learn metrics to tell us if it is good or not.

8
00:00:17.894 --> 00:00:22.015
我们将学习一些检测指标 判断模型是否效果不错

9
00:00:22.015 --> 00:00:24.615
And the second question is, once we figure that out,

9
00:00:22.015 --> 00:00:24.615
第二个问题是 检测效果后

10
00:00:24.614 --> 00:00:26.894
how do we improve it based on these metrics?

10
00:00:24.614 --> 00:00:26.894
如何根据这些指标改善模型？

11
00:00:26.894 --> 00:00:29.594
Let's dive right in and learn to evaluate,

11
00:00:26.894 --> 00:00:29.594
我们开始学习如何评估

12
00:00:29.594 --> 00:00:32.000
validate, and improve our machine learning models.

12
00:00:29.594 --> 00:00:32.000
验证和改善我们的机器学习模型吧
