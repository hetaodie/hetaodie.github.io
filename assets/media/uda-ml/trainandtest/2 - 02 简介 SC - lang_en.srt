00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,174
Here is the outline for this section.

2
00:00:02,174 --> 00:00:04,844
In machine learning, we have a problem to solve.

3
00:00:04,844 --> 00:00:08,910
Normally, the problem corresponds to evaluating some data and making predictions.

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,179
The problem is represented by this broken car over here.

5
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,304
Now, in order to solve it,

6
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:14,769
we have a few tools.

7
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:16,620
These tools are the algorithms,

8
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,200
things like linear or logistic regression, SVM's,

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,369
neural networks, decision trees, etc.

10
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,900
How do we know which tool works best?

11
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,419
Well, for that we have a bunch of measurement tools

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,255
and we use them to evaluate all the algorithms.

13
00:00:30,254 --> 00:00:32,399
Once we evaluate the algorithms and

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,754
their parameters and decide which ones are best for a problem,

15
00:00:35,755 --> 00:00:37,725
then, we go ahead and solve our problem.

16
00:00:37,725 --> 00:00:39,630
In this section, we learn

17
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,170
the measurement tools so we'll learn a bunch of metrics and techniques that will

18
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,480
tell us when an algorithm is working well with

19
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:49,689
the data and how to tweak them to work best for us.
